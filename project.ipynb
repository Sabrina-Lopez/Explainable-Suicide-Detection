       "'hi i dont really know how to phrase this situation but ill try. my life is at a really good point right now, im never really depressed over stuff and 99 percent of the time my mind is clear. im about to graduate high school and im really excited. however, people in my family and friend group have tons of issues. wether they sleep all day, hate themselves, or have no ambition to keep living on in this world, theyve got problems. i dont wanna sound like im gloating, but usually im the person that a lot of these people end up going to because usually im able to talk people through issues and help them in the long run. yeah sometimes their issues make me really sad and stuff because who doesnt feel sad when people are telling you they feel worthless.but today one of my best friends showed me that he was cutting and it really effected me. i talked to him about it and its mostly because of how painfully bored he is and he doesnt even know why hes doing it hes a pretty logical guy. he will go to class and just sit there for and hour most of the time doing nothing challenging because thats the way our school works. he has clinically diagnosed depression, has been to a psychiatric ward, and sees a therapist regularly. its only been a couple hours since he showed me his arm, and i didnt even see all of it. ive got two main problems right now. first i dont really know how to help him. he said literally the only thing i can really do is just hang out with him after school and on the weekends so he doesnt just sit in bed all day. ive been trying to make an effort to do that as much as i can but i need to do more. he said himself that as long as he goes to highschool, and considering its the law, hes going to feel this way until we graduate. i just need to know something i can do to help him, do i tell his parents? a therapist wont help he already goes to one. should i talk to him more about it tomorrow. i just dont knowsecond, stuff like this is really effecting me. i just feel that the world is being unfair to everyone i care about and i just want everyone i love to feel better. as of lately ive been feeling depressed whenever my friends need to talk about issues and its really weighing down on me. i just dont want to leave the people i care about down in the dirt. so yeah if anyone has any advice whatsoever please help me. im normally able to deal with these feelings and help my friends but right now im struggling. thank you '"
