48,I (19M) feel like I'm reaching a breaking point.,ive been feeling depressed af the last few months it sort of feels like a relapse after about 6 months of a reasonably healthy mental statebasically i feel physically drained of energy all day i have zero motivation to study or try in any way whatsoever in college im doing a notoriously tough course and barely passed my christmas exams i come home exhausted but when i go to bed i just become really agitated and irritated my heart starts pounding and i struggle to breathe i cant get comfortable and even if go to bed exhausted at 89pm i wouldnt get to sleep until 23am  however in the mornings i struggle so much to get out of bed i feel like theres almost zero point getting up anyway as i wouldnt even miss out on anything i end up missing so many of my lectures simply becuase i cannot bring myself to get out of bed i still live at home going to college but if i lived by myself without parents i could see myself just staying in bedmy room for days at a time every day passes by in a sort of blur for me i feel like i almost have a depersonalization disorder as i just operate in autopilot i feel like a shell its almost like im just empty inside i dont feel emotions everything just feels monotonous and numb  honestly i really just dont give a fuck about anything anymore i used to have passions like playing musicsportreadingfilms etc but nothing excites me anymore i feel like i dont really have an emotional outlet its like im just existing daytoday without actually living since i find close to zero pleasure in general life i selfmedicate with weed i guess its just a coping mechanism in order to feel something other than numb i also think i have memory loss as the last couple months have really blurred i honestly dont know where the time has gone or what ive been doing in that time i also have really really bad eating habits i dont generally eat breakfast and then could go the day without eating however when i come home i often would binge until i struggle to breathe i also feel socially exhausted every day i have to go into college pretending to be someone im not is mentally draining as i feel like im putting on a fake persona just to mask the numbness when all i wanna do is just go to bedget high this is probably part of the reason i avoid going to lectures this all eventually caused me to go to the student couseling services in my college sometime last week however i feel like i wasnt as honest as i should have been regarding my situation i was definitely making it out to be less severe than it actually is they set me up with counselling sessions that start in 3 weeks however i feel like my ability to function has been severely impaired in the last few days tonight i felt the urge to selfharm for the first time and honestly if i had clean razors i would already have done so i dont think i can wait 3 weeks for my counselling appointment i feel like i should go to a gppsychiatrist and see what they think i feel like i just want someone to tell me exactly what i have im 99 sure its depression and perhaps symptomatic  insomniaa binge eating disorder i guess part of me still denies its depression despite me knowing that it almost certainly is and i feel like i need a medical professional to tell me how it is in order for me to be able to work on getting better i guess i also want to see if they think that medication could help too ultimately i just want treatment as soon as possible something concrete i can show to myself to tell me that im taking steps to improve myself as atm i feel so lost in life and i feel like a breakingpoint might come soon unless i change things i really dont know where to go from here i guess this post is just a reflection maybe i just want to get my thoughts down somewhere but if anyone has any advice obviously id rly appreciate that like most ppl here i just wanna feel normal again  if anyone would be willing to talk about things a bit more in detail id appreciate a pm,0,depression
49,Quite a lot of suicidal thoughts lately....,so this is getting straight out of fucking hand im a young male studying and i feel like whatevers this feeling anxiety depression stress i have no fucking clue is catching up with me now supposedly i have a loving family friends all that shit you already know but i dont want to talk to them not even my gf in whom id trust almost anything grades are fucking reverse skyrocketing i cant get myself to sit down and study shit im probably going to fail music even although i have been taught music in a music school for about 7 years i just dont understand some subjects and probably wont at all worst part is we are having a trip to ireland before the summer break and you are automatically chosen out if you fail 2 or more subjects i will probably fail french music spanish math and most likely physics and chemistry now of all of those i just used to struggle with math btwso just recently ive started cutting myself again not serious wounds straight in the veins but cuts in my left hand and arm which stay there for quite a while i will most likely continue doing so as my grades keep coming in i will most likely get any source of music taken away from me pc mp3 phone and this wont help at all with the situation also recently i started going out with a girl i liked since 23 years ago and she has liked me for the same time this is the first relationship for both of us none of us has ever kissed made out with anyone etc and we are both really shy and i have had friends since the start of the relationship weve been together for 3 months now trying to pressure both of us into making out i as the coward i am obviously couldnt make it happen despite her fucking telling me she wants to and ive also had quite a high number of suicidal thoughts lately mostly think of how could i do itthink of hanging myself od to death find a gun somewhere not common at all in my country and blow my head off cut myself tie a rope around my neck and stretch it so hard i die sealing my swimming pool while turning on the water for it to slowly rise and drown me put a toaster with me in the bath im quite creative reallyalso ive been finding it hard to find reasons to stay alive i feel like a burden for my gf and family only see myself as a weight they must lift to carry on and never ever feel like doing something useful that someone would be thankful for,1,suicidal
50,I keep spamming on this sub. Sorry,i know its really dumb to keep spamming and spamming ive already made two other posts here unless it was actually three and i have the memory of a goldfish i just feel alone as hell and i need to vent again im pissed at myself for eating today the plan was not to eat anything this month but i fucked that up hopefully starting tomorrow ill be able to control my fatass self and not eat until april and i started cutting again today so thats great but im actually so fucking pathetic that i cant even cut that deep because it hurts too much i cut my neck which is just dumb as hell since the neck is difficult to cover the sad part is that a small part of me wants people to see thats super fucked up why would i want that i have an appointment with a psychiatrist tomorrow hopefully he can give me meds that actually work that is my last hope otherwise suicide is my only option if i just have the guts to go through with it i dont know why i keep ranting but thanks for reading,1,suicidal

52,Emotional hurricane,so this is my first reddit post so bear with me i am not suicidal so i dont want anyone to think i am in dire need of assistance i dont want to scare anyone but i do have depression for 23 years now i wrote a journal entry today that kind of illustrates how i constantly feel 247 ive been journaling on and off for maybe 6 years but tonight after 7 months of not writing i just felt this urgent need to put my feelings to pen and paper reading it back its kind of scary knowing myself how dark it is if that makes sense  i dont really know why im posting it maybe someone out there will say same bitch i feel the same fuckin wayyyyy who knows anyways here goesmarch 4th 2020ampx200bwhat does it mean when you feel so sadlosthopeless but none of your friends or family seem to notice to be constantly around people but to feel so alone to feel like youre being sucked into this black hole but no one is around to help you out to not really know how you feel to wishing you were brave enough to tell other how youre feeling to reach out for help but at the same time feeling hurt because nobody seems to care to want someone to look into your eyes and see the sadness and tell you its going to be okay for the ones closest to you to hear the lie in your laugh to feel alone abandoned like youll never be happy again to be so scared that youll feel this sad and lonely forever sometimes i really wonder if there is a single person out there that cares about my feelings about my health about my state of mind i try so hard to be shoulder to cry on for my loved ones to be a support system but what about me ive spent my whole life putting other peoples needs before my own and now that im trying so hard to focus on myself and put my needs first im alone even the few people ive shared my feelings with are nowhere to be seen whats the point in sharing if nobody cares because nobody cares right i think its pretty obvious at this point so what do you do when you have no support system  no one in your corner to encourage you to fight for you to fight for you when theres no one to tell you its going to be okay to give you a hug while you cry because youre always crying i dont know i just want my smile to be real again,0,depression

55,My story,last year i was a freshman in highshighschool near the end i was ready i was gonna do it then one of the people told my mom and got me help i told 3 people john alex and gabriel kohn said he would help me but lied alex did nothing and gabriel helped me a few nights ago john texted me this is our conversationjohn i know you hate and despise me with a passion but i must ask why i just kinda needed some clearence im not here to pick a fight with you but to come to an understanding so looks like u have spent 10 mins typing i guess i can expect a bomb drop on me or somme i was on the verge of suicide and u said u would do something u promised and i hoped deep down someone would i was going to kill my fucking self on the 13 of july that year stab in the heart with a fuckin knife u promised me someone who i dispite all other judgement thought was a good if not the closest friend i had u did nothing u wouldve let me die it was gabriel the one who i thought wouldnt give a shit because of all the shit we went through it was him who got me the fucking help i hate u so fuck much so so much with all my fucking heart every muscle and bone and tendon and bit of flesh burns with hatred when i even think about u and the worst part is i cant unthink it i cant just forget an entire year cause i fuckin would forget u exist forget the entirety of 8th grade then some more u go around saying oh jay was just faking it he wanted the attention i was going to fuckin die and u were gonna sit there and watch with ur thumb up ur ass like some sorta fuckin beast of the fields then u come back to me and ask what i did wrong why do u hate me like thats a question then ur not even gonna say sorry u werent just a shitty friend ur a shitty person and i made it my mission now to stop people from making the same mistake i did trusting u fuck i was a goddamn idiot but it doesnt even matter now i know where everyone stands when i asked them to pick a side a while back and they said they were with me only to lie and be with u i know now i only hate 3 things u hitler and satan and u u didnt even do just that u hit ur brother u shot at me with a bb gun u hit my head with a bat and each time i tried to be a friend have someone by myside thought it would be u guess not then theres ur sarcasm again and i could keep going but ur rushing me so herejohn well holy shit that was okay

that attention you arent gonna believe me but i am honestly truly sorry if you felt and continue to feel this way i mean i never wanted any of this i was led to believe that you had gone mad and i had to leave it at there suicide is stupid by the way i have considered that for myself in the past and im telling you it does not go well because those who have acted on that literally destroy their loved ones you need to understand that i never wanted to hurt you in the way that you felt i just thought it was a bucket of bullshit but i know realize you needed help look i wanna clear the air here

when i caught hold of u i invited u all to my birthday where everyone fucked off on their own leaving me once again alone to top that off all 3 of u alex gabriel and u tried to leave then homecoming where my past finally caught up to me i met someone we went on a date and it was ok i got to the house only to find some cunt who left the group who u took the place of and he told them everything about me how i hurt people without remorse and how i would so it again and how i was dangerous and shit they knew and i went with them they tried confronting me about it but i lied i hate liars and i lied to make that worse she was with someone else and i couldnt do shit about it when i go over to look for u bing notification everyone except me with the caption only friends i need or something i

I don't know what to do anymore.",hi im an eighth grader at a magnet school i have add attention deficit disorder symptoms of depression and im suicidal for the past 3 years ive slowly been less and less motivated to do anything even what i enjoy i just want to go to sleep forever and forget about all the stress of school and a difficult social life i get very stressed over school as the stakes go up and my mom is constantly reminding me that ill be a failure if i get too many bs it doesnt help that my friends began ignoring me more and more when we started middle school with new better people to hang out with than me im treated like a tagalong now my former best friends only talk to me and listen when theyre bored and nobody else is there to talk to i started having thoughts of suicide near the end of seventh grade but its really gotten worse this year as more is expected of me and my friends cast me further away i decided to finally talk to someone this year since my previous hints of needing help went unnoticed by my mom on a day where i felt very low mentally i told my mom i was suicidal i broke down crying and she hugged me however she said dont ever even think about killing yourself do you know what that would do to me i was a little upset about her reaction as she seemed more concerned about herself but i kept telling her more i told her about how i thought i had depression and she dismissed it as stress and said it would stop if i started to be positive i was taken aback by this i love my mother a lot but shes never been good at giving advice or helping with my mental health i got mad at her and began yelling about her never understanding or helping with my feelings i was a little too extreme but the anger was not irrational she yelled back something about her trying to help with the grief counselor 1 she didnt help very much 2 she was there to help us deal with grief over a family death and she didnt help with my suicidalness what made me feel worthless was when she yelled what do you want me to do about it and told her i wanted her there for me to talk to and she went on about my grades what have i told you learn to deal with your emotions better  etc i ran off crying to continue my homework a few minutes later she came in with her phone and my dad was on a call she had told him she was mad about me not focusing on my homework and i needed to hurry it up and finish and stop crying i kept crying upset she didnt help and a few minutes later my dad arrives he was upset that i wasnt working on the project and wasting time i kept crying until he started yelling to stop crying i stopped tears welling in my eyes i love my dad too but he cant control his anger very well and he follows his parents ways of discipline which is what he grew up with as he lectured me i started clawing my arm to calm myself like i always do he noticed me leaving scars on my arm and got angrier he told me to stop and said this do you want me to do it for you this really upset me but i said nothing to avoid an argument he got me to finish the project he said he cared about me and loved me and he left no discussion of my mental state my mom called him when i started crying later and he wasnt mad this time he told me to go to sleep and feel better i didnt feel better when i slepti just needed to get all that out ive been considering suicide a lot and i know theres help everywhere like hotlines and such but it wont help i need people i care about to talk to i lost my grandma in december of 2018 to cancer she listened and cared i have no one i know of now my friends dont listen and i feel like they think i talk about sad stuff too much i just need to know what to do because i honestly dont know anymore the people i care about most cant help me and i feel worthless i never know what to talk about and when i get to talk for once my friends look at me different than they do at other friends they look lost bored and like they want me to hurry up and get it over with then they go back to talking to the other people i just need some advice if you read this whole vent then you are an amazing person and i hope you have a wonderful day,0,depression
74,Letter from my girlfriend,ampx200bmy girlfriend wrote me this letter and agreed to share it here ampx200bletter to my depressed loveri see you i know youre in there the man who loved and sought joy the man who feltdeserving of happiness he is blindfolded held hostage cold and chained in a windowlessbasement by a tyrant who thrives off suffering at times it feels like there is no hope attimes it feels like there is no escape you are weakened the exhaustion has taken over yourbody your mind and your soul you question whether youll ever be strong enough to fightthis mighty tyrant to escape from his grip out of the darkness will you ever be able to feelthe sun stroking your skin again will you ever see the light again will you ever feel loveagainwhy are you here how did you get here you never asked for this no one woulda tyrant is an illegitimate ruler who controls through oppression tyranny is not fair it is notunderstanding and it is cruel the tyrant wants to weaken you until you have no choice butto succumb he will brainwash you until you come to terms with his reign until you are nolonger a threat to him the tyrant wants you to think that he is too strong to ever beat toomighty to outthink too present to escapebut let me tell you something about tyrants anger hate always stems from fear and painbehind every tyrant is a hurt child behind every tyrant is a voice that was once unheard aheart that was once broken eyes that were once blinded the tyrant doesnt want you tosee the light because the light was once taken from him he doesnt want you to know lovebecause love was once taken from him and he wants you to hurt because he hurtsbut how can tyranny be defeated when tyranny is defeated by force it often just pavesthe way for another form of tyranny you dont want to kill your tyrant youll be left withblood on your hands and trauma in your soul if you kill youll have to hide and what is thepoint of fighting your way out of the darkness just to make your way into another form ofdarknessno your tyrant wont be defeated by force he will be defeated by love and i know thatyour love is strong enough to turn him aroundthe man that i love finds joy in the little things the touch of the grass against his feet thesight of birds in the trees the sound of a stick falling on icy water the man that i love issurprising he is unapologetically original passionate and doted of a natural humour theman that i love is caring and has an emotional intelligence that can make anyone aroundhim feel seen heard and loved the man that i love is wise he can offer advice that younever knew you needed and he can be the ray of sunshine in anyones day the man that ilove will lighten up entire rooms and soothe even your deepest worries with care andattention the man that i love can love so strongly so unconditionally so powerfully thathe can make anyones darkness fade away so if anyone is going to bring this tyrant downit will be the man that i lovelove can make your tyrant feel seen it can make him feel comfortable enough to talkcomfortable enough to tell you about what pain led him to tyranny when faced with lovewith a powerful unconditional love and an acceptance that is free of all judgment yourampx200btyrant will be able to start facing up to his actions he will be able to start realising that allalong he was causing you to suffer for reasons that had nothing to do with you they werenever your fault he was only causing you to suffer because he was suffering when thatrealisation will spring upon him he will remove your blindfold and you will see that you arefacing yourself but dont worry its just a mask the tyrant originally wore to trouble you hewont wish to do that anymore though hell unchain you and remove his mask and you willrealise that all along your tyrant was only a child suddenly the anger you felt towards yourtyrant will vanish because you are a man who is fair just and loving you are a man whodoesnt believe in punishment nor revenge you are a man who can forgive you are a manwho can recognise when a child simply needs to be held loved and nurturedso you will take the childs hand at first he will be fearful he has been hurt before whosto say that you wont hurt him but you will give him your word you will promise him thathe is safe with you and deep in your heart you will know that you are telling the truth thechild will weep in your arms and you will hold him tighter you will tell him that he is lovedhe is heard he is seen and that from this moment forward he will never be aloneyou will come out of the basement with the child hand in hand and although at first it willfeel like a relief it wont be easy you havent seen the sun in so long its light will feelblinding and uncomfortable your body will still feel weak and as youll barely feel able tolook after yourself youll start to wonder how you could possibly look after this child butyou will surprise yourself through the small pleasures you once enjoyed such as feeling thecool grass underneath your feet you will find strength enough strength to lift yourself upcarry the child and start walking it will be challenging and youll worry that each stepmight be your last step youll worry that you might fall and never find the strength to getback up but youll keep putting a foot in front of the other until it starts to feel naturaleventually youll look up and realise that the sun isnt as blinding as it was when you firstcame out youll see a path and youll know how to get homeon your way home you will worry that bringing this child back might be too much of aburden for me what if i dont want him what if i dont love him after all he was once atyrant how could i love him and what if i dont even love you anymore youve been gonefor so long what if ive stopped waiting what if ive given up what if ive found someoneelse what if i just end up hurting you and the child more than youve both already beenhurtbut all this time ive been

overview over my entire life and what exactly it is right now that lead me to the decision that my life is not worth living anymoreelementary school was hell had a teacher that sat me behind a bookshelf from which i wasnt even able to see the blackboard or participate in class because i was distracing the other children the teacher videotaped me misbehaving in class to ridicule my parents and parentsmeetings i was a smart kid i was able to write and do basic math before i went to school i was bored when i was finished with my stuff i walked through the room and helped the children that were struggling i dont see any misbehaving in that but maybe im wrong final report card was straight as teacher still recommended that i go to a school for idiots in my country this recommendation is on the report card when i applied at normal schools not a single one wanted to teach me because of that recommendation which was just straigh up bullshit in the end i found a school that saw my potential and didnt care about the recommendation so i was able to get a decent educationwhile all of that was happening home was hell my dad was violent and abusive and my mother never intervened when he punched me in the face etc i dont know if she did not care or if she was afraid it doesnt matter to me i felt and still feel abandoned from age 912 my older brother was raping me over and over not like once a  month or something every single day sometimes even multiple times but who should i have asked for help my father that is violent me my mother that doesnt do shit he even invited his friends to watch and spit on mewith 14 i had the realization that i wasnt normal anymore i wasnt talking alot i stopped enjoying literally anything thats also when i started to cut myselffast forward to me being 19 i finished school got my highschool diploma eventhough i was suffering from severe depression as i found out later i also had 1 friend lets call her l i got a job over 100 miles away from my parents i moved out lived there in terrible conditions since i made almost no money but i think i felt better im not sure since i was stoned most of the time after 3 years living away from my parents l tried to commit suicide i blame myself but i dont want to get into detail of why that is she survived i was there for her i took all my years vacation to be there for her 6 months later i live with my parents again since i was breaking down and wasnt able to take care of myself anymore i admit myself to a mental hospital because i was highly suicidal and l urged me to do it after i admitted myself l blocked me on all social media up to this day this was 3 years ago i stayed 3 months in the hospital and learned alot i learned that i suffer from depression paranoia narcissm have borderline personality disorder and have symptoms that might be a psychosis but no one can confirm or deny this i was talking about all the stuff that happened to me but i learned nothing to cope with that stuff or accept it or stop thinking about it constantly basically i was worse than before everything was fresh in my mind but no one taught me how to deal with that stuff but hospital said i was healedi moved out from my parents again and got a job in a callcenter since that was the only thing available in my hometown i got minimum wage had to have crazy amounts of knowledge had extreme stats i had to reach or i was laid off and i hated every second i was sick alot like alot every 23 weeks i had something from colds flu migrane etci stayed for a whole year eventho i was sick often i had exceptional stats 99 customer satisfaction with extremely low talk time etc then i quit i couldnt take it anymore the constant pressure knowing that i will never be promoted no matter how good i am constant stuggle with money i was miserableso i went into a different mental hospital did dialectic behavioural therapy instead of trauma therapy learned to use skills which is basically just finding something to occupy your brain so you stop thinking your sick sad thoughts does it solve anything no not at all do i feel better noin therapy i found a girlfriend she is perfect she talks with me she is understanding but im struggling so hard since i have this paranoia that literally any person on this planet is just trying to hurt me i trust her i know that my thoughts are not real but it hurts so fucking much just a few days ago she got her period almost 2 weeks earlier than expected my thought process to this situation was well she was partying with her friends last weekend she probably fucked a dude there got planb and one the side effects is that your period might come earlier or later than expected like what the hell how do you even come up with something like that i feels like i just want to hurt myself i should be happy she is doing everything she can and i cant appreciate it since my mind is just thinking up storys to hurt me this literally makes me feel like im insane why would i do that to menow im unemployed get my money from health insurance well for the next week that is my psychiatrist told me that he wont be writing me sick any longer he gave me no reason why he wont continue since he is 100 aware of my mental state that means i dont get any money from my health insurance anymore since they think im healthy which means i have to get money from the state for

250,My Depression,the thoughts of a 30yearold depressed guy i am afraid of well not afraid but the things i think about on a regular basis i worry if my daughter will be taken away from because of my crazy exwife i worry about what my daughter thinks or will think of me because i have no goals or ambitions right now other than to make enough money to outshine my exwife i want to do all these things but i am too worried about everything that will go wrong with them i want to start a business and be successful but i am afraid of failure and getting stuck right back where i am which is like resetting my whole life i worry about if i am going to get cancer because i am addicted to chewing tobacco and want to stop for my daughters sake because i dont want it to influence her life because i have been told it is bad for you i worry about being alone the rest of my life because i cant seem to find anyone who loves me or is it because i am to shallow and dont think anyone over 150 lbs is pretty i cant sleep because my mind races and races at night and these things flow through my mind i worry about looking successful to the people around me which holds me back because i dont want to show how unsuccessful i am right now i feel like a failure and a worthless person the only thing that gets me through the really really tough thoughts is my daughter and if i wasnt here who would raise her the pressure around me to do the right thing is tremendous but what is the right thing is the right thing what everyone thinks or what is socially acceptable is the right thing what i think is right but then why do other people think some of the things i do are wrong what makes them right i think about the things in my past that i could have done differently but whats the point i cant change them so why do i dwell on them do i need to even worry about them i worry about how i am going to pay for things if i lose my va disability but i dont want to go to my va appointments because i feel it reinforces the fact that i am messed up and i come up with excuses as to why i shouldnt go to try to reason with myself as to why its ok not to go its also a distance away which wastes 2 hours of my days sitting at home doing nothing so is it helpful to go to an appointment and lie to a doc for 15 mins telling him that every things ok and i take meds which i dont take my meds because 1 i hate taking medication every day and 2 i dont like to think taking them helps but they do because if i took them then i might not be writing this i know i need to do better but i work at a deadend job that has no future for me i am just a pawn in someone elses business story i want to make more money but i dont know where to go because no one is telling me where to go and i am afraid to start anything just to fail i dont want to waste my time doing something and have that time taken from me by an unforeseen event but why do i worry about an unforeseen event when i cant even see it coming is my life that messed up that i am worried about something that may or may not happen i sit here typing this looking into my baby monitor telling myself i need to do better for my daughter what example am i setting for her if i dont do anything with my life i thought i had my whole life planned out then boom my world is rocked by an unhealthy relationship which everyone but me saw everyone told me i shouldnt have been with that girl everyone told me i needed to leave her but as cliché why did i just look up how to spell cliché in something i am only going to read as it sounds i loved her or at least what i thought was love i was ready to spend my life with her but she went and fucked two other people and who knows how many others but blamed me because she thought i had an affair which i didnt have an affair i write this hoping my feelings will leave my body and i will not worry about them anymore but for how long is it going to last is this really going to help maybe ill post this on some reddit website and become famous for it ha who am i kidding i am nobody i am a middle age man who has been handed a fuckedup life and cant get out but its not as fucked up as some peoples lives so why does mine hurt so bad maybe i am stuck on the materialistic things and want to hide behind them like having a nice truck but not as nice as the one i want because i am smart enough not to burry myself in debt and have that looming over me i am content on doing nothing but am afraid of everything i tell myself i am meant for more but i dont know how to get there i am smart but not smart enough to figure out how to make myself happy so am i really that smart i can tell you all night and day that i am smarter than what i am doing right now but have nothing to show for it i think everyone is out to get me in some way shape or form i dont trust anyone i think they all have some agenda to serve themselves but dont we all is anyone truly selfless now i am just rambling to ramble so focus focus on why i am writing this focus focus focus why why am i handed a dealt of cards that has no instructions is that life whats the purpose why do i even waste my time why cant i win the lottery and hide behind the money at least i will be able to do the things that make me happy because i wont be constrained by money but if i did have it would i really be happy i think it would be better than where i am but why would i be so lucky as to win the lottery when there are stronger people out there who deserve it more than me is luck a figment of our imaginations are all the strings being pulled by some divine or supreme power some might say i am on drugs right now to think like this im not this is how my mind works and i think its a blessing and a curse who will even read this now its just becoming to long for the quick reader to think its interesting and too short for anyone to take it seriously but im not writing it for them i am writing it for myself i want to get better i want to do better but where are the answers do i make up the answers and hope i get by do i tell lies and belittle other people to get through life why not it feels like other people all people do it to me who is coming to punish those who do me wrong do i do it no why because i am afraid of the consequences i am pressured by everyone to do the right thing maybe thats what governs people then why doesnt everyone act the same are there to many questions in this who cares its mine right maybe i will share this so someone can laugh someone can feel empowered to do the same someone can belittle me i need to do better i need to push myself to do better i started working out because i thought i might get laid if i look better but is anyone even going to notice i wasnt in shape before and got laid sort of i more or less have always found the girl who is in need and made her feel better then when that wears off i am alone am i going to be alone for the rest of my life at least i have my daughter right but eventually she will leave me too because no one wants to be around someone as depressed as me i wouldnt want to be around me i always hear this saying on the radio or tv or what have you  you have to love yourself before anyone can love you who am i kidding i will always be alone because i dont see myself loving myself i am fat ugly and stupid i dont have any value i dont have the ability to love anyone else because i just want to use the other person to make myself feel better but how is that does that even make sense am i connecting with anyone if this is circulating around and you are reading this far then possibly should i keep going maybe i still feel like going my fingers are starting to hurt but it feels a little better to not have all these things bottled up inside me maybe its because i am pretending to type it to an imaginary audience so things i worry about i worry about paying bills but i am good at financial stuff so thats ok but i still worry about them i worry that i am not doing the right thing i worry about what other people think of me but thats ridiculous i should not worry about that right i worry about the spelling in this but i have spell check i worry about sleeping all day when i have my daughter because she could hurt herself because she is 2 i also worry she is going to grow up and think i just slept all the time but she doesnt know i was up until 3am writing a stupid paper about the things i worry about but thats not her fault i worry about making a good impression on the people around me because i dont want to be alone and the only people around me is family right now i seem to piss everyone else off why do i piss them off because i am pushing people away so they cant hurt me is that an excuse i worry about getting into an accident and not being able to take care of my responsibilities but should i i worry about being someone elses burden i dont want to hinder someone elses life with my inability to love myself it is no ones problem but my own but there are people who want to help me or are they getting paid to do so because someone decided it was good for business to make money on others suffering cancer maybe thats too much i definitely cant post this anywhere now i worry about getting up in the morning and it being my last day i worry that all of this will pile up and ill do something i cant take back but thats why i think of my daughter i worry ill be trapped in this life and these circumstances for a long time because i am too afraid to take a leap of faith and just try to make my life better i worry about anything and everything i dont care about anyone other than my daughter truly her life is the only real thing i care about she is so innocent am i contaminating her life by being in it though is my negative thinking rubbing off on her and will she be like me i hope not i see the negative in everything i cant think fast but when i do think at my own pace i can figure shit out i worry about being in a situation i cant think my way out of i truly worry about everything my daughter is being pushed into school well i think so her mother doesnt want her to not be in school because she is ready i think its because her mom doesnt want to take care of her and wants to push her into school so someone else must deal with her she seems too young to start preschool in my mind why do i care so much about what my exwife is doing or thinks maybe it is because i have to deal with her for the rest of my life not like she is going away and i cant not talk to her because then the court will see me as being unfit to parent then i will lose my daughter i dont want that now do i i feel like my exwife has her life together and mine is falling apart underneath me but maybe she is just hiding it like i am trying to do but im the one writing this so we will stick with my feelings i dont want to lose my daughter but everything i do i am feeling like it is a

353,Scared,ive always wanted to find my soulmate but im so scared that no one will ever love me back i know that this is the stupidest reason to be sad about but romance is something that ive dreamed of since i was a kid  no one likes me in a romantic way there has only been one person who had a crush on me in my entire life and it lasted a only a month everyday i find out that my friends are dating people and they post pictures with their significant others and every time i see those posts i feel like crying,0,depression
354,Letter,i have spent the past three days typing up a suicide letter and as i near the end of it i find myself growing anxiety riddled and realizing how many people care enough about me in life that i felt the need to give an explanation to personally so then i went back through and added a section for if i didnt die by suicide because part of me just doesnt want to go through with it anymore after writing it which i am pretty sure isnt the point of a suicide letter but i care about them so much that i dont want to imagine their faces when they read it everything has just been so hard recently and im really tired both physically and emotionally i am tired of all the losses i am tired of classes i am tired of the way some of my relationships are headed i just want to rest and stop feeling so overwhelmed i want to be there for my friends who are also struggling one in particular who has been there for me more then anyone in my entire life and is potentially going through a similar problem as my own but they havent been answering my text messages and i can only assume its because they dont want to bother me now that i think about it i never want to bother them either which is why i bottle everything up i wish society didnt teach us that there are such things as negative emotions that need to be locked away from other peoples views if we could all be honest with each other without feeling its a burden on those we love i wonder how many lives could be saved and how many deep conversations could be had with our loved ones i just feel bad because if anything i just feel like im in the way of everyone elses progress and just adding another problem on their mountain of problems everyone deserves better then me and i wish there was a way to get myself out the way that wouldnt potentially hurt them more then i already am,1,suicidal
355,"I’m 21, just recently realized my dad is a terrible person and my childhood fucked me up more than anyone can see. I feel hopeless and have no life skills. Think my family is cursed(?)",my dad is an immigrant and came the us in his 30s after he married my 18 year old mother who was studying abroad in his home countryhe quickly became financially successful and moderately famous in his industry things that came to define him above anything elsemy parents had me 11 years into their marriage and i have no siblings i was homeschooled for most of my childhood and super sheltered from everything in life never allowed to have sleepovers rarely allowed to have friends over had every moment of my life scheduled and micromanaged  i was never encouraged to pursue anything except becoming a professional soccer player which was never what i wanted to do but something my dad wanted me to do as a way to live out his dreams through me vicariously he was never around he financially supported me and my mom and lived in the same city as us most of the time but was never there to parent me and was rarely even around on holidays or birthdays he kept his things at our house but came home maybe once a month sometimes less he always said he needed to be closer to work so he was staying at his friends house everything in the whole city is a 30 minute drive or less and he never worked for anyone but himself now that im an adult i understand he was living with various girlfriends though he was still married to my mom and she always seemed to be waiting up for him to come home and finally be a dadhusband i developed severe anorexia at 12 and my family seemed to ignore it even though i stopped growing lost 40 pounds was rarely eating and was exercising 46 hours a day when i was literally weeks away from death with a bmi of lt12 my mom finally took me to a doctor after my grandma begged her to because something was really wrong with me the doctor told her i was  anorexic and recommended inpatient treatment and psychotherapy my mom yelled at the doctor said theres no way my daughter is anorexic and stormed out of the office for the next 6 months or so i stayed at the same weight and nightly would sit down at the dinner table with my mom and cry for hours while she screamed at me to finish my food i never went to therapy for the eating disorder and she denied every doctor who told her i was mentally ill she was sure i had tapeworms a thyroid disease celiac or some other ailment that had caused me to lose 40 of my body weight i stayed at a dangerously low weight until i was 16 which is the first year i went to school and traded my ed for nightly sneaking out binge drinking and bulimia when i was 16 i was almost arrested for trying to buy alcohol and my dad found out and told me if i wanted alcohol i could just ask him he started helping me sneak out and giving me alcohol whenever i wanted i think he did this to drive a wedge between my mom and me he always loved to have secrets that we would keep from her he would take me around his 23 year old girlfriend and tell me to not tell my mom in fact he would blackmail me saying things like dont tell mom about so and so you would hate for her to find out about you sneaking out and partying right when i was 17 my dad lost all his businesses and wealth and has still been unable to recover from the financial loss he pinned all his happiness on money and once it was gone he changed completely every time ive talked to him since then all hes talked about is how broke he is and how my mom caused his financial ruin and what a stupid idiot she is he curses my mom around me almost every time he talks to mehe had a long talk with me one night when i was 16 he told me that i should never have kids because theyll ruin my life he never wanted kids he would be a multi millionaire and so happy and free if he had never had a family my mom is a crazy lunatic and has only ruined his life and finances i fell into a horribly abusive 4 year relationship with a guy when i was 17 i bounced around from college to vocational school and also had a moderately successful entertainment career ive never been able to find footing anywhere i feel like i cant connect with anyone i really dont feel passion for anything and dont feel like theres any path in life that i want to take though i do feel like im talented in multiple things im awful at romantic relationships and friendships maybe because i never had a healthy relationship example from my family and never had long term friendships when i was growing up about a year ago i was talking with my dad about how i wanted to get a job that made a lot of money like bottle service he suggested i become a stripper and so i did i danced for a year and he insisted i call him and tell him how much money i made every night and he acted like i was so lucky because he gave me permission to do this like wtf im a grown adult whos been living on my own since 18 and god knows i was putting in the work all on my own for all the money i made every time i see him hes so negative and toxic and i realize now that a lot of the anxiety and problems i felt as a child ive been suicidal literally since i can remember stemmed from the insane toxic energy that always engulfed my family life ive done a lot of psychedelics and i really do have a good grip on spirituality and mindfulness and know theres something way bigger than this earth plane we live on there are light forces and dark forces the thing is lately i just dont feel like i am meant to be blessed by the light forces like i was born out of darkness from a cursed family and i am doomed to be miserable depressed and toxic just like my dad he is not a good person i think hes a narcissistic sociopath and it scares me that half of my genes come from that his dad was a total narcissist no respect for women i felt unexplainably awful vibes from him always my paternal grandfather had a very successful business when he was younger but somehow that all dissolved and he ended up completely broke with nothing to leave to his family dementia and a mindset that his children should take care of him which they did until his death last year my aunt put herself through unspeakable stress and pain to take care of my grandfather who was completely ungrateful for it most of my dads family has ended up in a mental hospital by 70 and theyre all completely depressed or mentally ill and i feel the same demons taking me under every day ive felt dark forces around me since i can remember ive seen my demons during nightmares and sleep paralysis i think my abusive exboyfriend was influenced by the demons that follow me around i cant see anything good happening in my life long term i fear im going to end up like everyone on my dads side i recently talked about a lot of this stuff with my mom and she started crying and said shes failed me in every way she shouldve left my dad when i was little and she wishes she never even married him because she was a teenager and literally only knew him for a few months before they got married that hit so hard because it just made me feel like my whole life was never even supposed to happen i was just part of one giant fucked up mistake made by a naive 18 year old i feel like im a lost soul i wasnt meant to exist and because of that the dark energy got ahold of me i dont want to talk to my dad anymore am i wrong i am questioning everything and i really hope i dont live that long because i dont see anyone in that family having any glimmer of a nice life over age 55 no one takes me seriously when i say my childhood fucked me up so much because i grew up with a lot of material possessions money and a seemingly super involved mother when people think of bad childhoods they think of poverty physical abuse druggie parents things like that maybe im a spoiled brat but either way im just not happy i cant remember ever ever being happy for more than a couple days at a time whats wrong with me,0,depression

466,I'm failing school and I cant explain to the teachers why I'm doing bad because they won't care,im getting really bad grades in a class i used to be really good at and in another class im being really disorganized losing sheets and not getting homework done on time truth is im exhausted from the moment i wake up so ill just sleep when i get home or ill need to distract myself with a low effort activity rather than concentrate on homework to calm myself down from wanting to hurt myself but im just lazy right its so frustrating being seen as careless when im just trying to survive but my teachers expect me to get over myself because everyone goes through hard times im already seeing a school counsellor whos not helping in any way and its in secret because my parents wont let me see a proper therapist yesterday when i got 2 essays back i got e on both of them and i just wanted to tear my hair out because im trying so hard to balance everything out but its not good enough seriously all i can think about is killing myself and its good enough that i actually come into school when i dont want anyone to see me because i feel too ugly and i try to socialise with people and not zone out in class for like 8 hours i just want everyone to know i have depression and help me out in any way but no they dont give a shit so ill just fail and theyll never know why,0,depression
467,What the fuck am I still doing here?,so ive wanted to kill myself for the longest ive even made several failed attempts ive prayed to god for death for him to take me in my sleep and every morning after that when i wake up i cried because i still exist i have grown to ultimately hate myself i feel like the most trash ass human beingwhen i try to express this to other people it will either be met with the tough love reprimand or i end up pushing that person away because of my negative energyi dont even know myself anymore i dont have any more passion for things i once did cooking massage therapy i attempt to develop motivation but my depression and anxiety will team up with the ptsd i incurred from being robbed when i notice negative selftalk ill try to change my thought patterns but it always ends up back at the world would be better off if you were gone but im too much of a coward to try and take myself out againi just want to be happy man i want to be who i was before i figured out i was raised in cps who i was before being orphaned who i was before being the states property and another statisticwhy the fuck am i still alive,1,suicidal

472,I don't even want help anymore,im fucking tired of people telling that everything will be fine and i feel like theyre the ones that are ill for not seeing how fucked up the world is just look at this sub every few minutes someone desperately looks for help and tells how miserable he or she is sometimes without even being noticed now think of how many of all suffering people dont even seek for help because nobody gives a fuck thats the human nature its just that it hurts even if someone wants to help you its just because he or she will feel as a better person and then will leave you like a trash that you are so why even bother looking for help maybe depression is just a name created by people who are too scared of what reality is like what if depression is perceiving the world as it is while having good mental health means to disctract oneself from others pain or maybe im just talking shit i dont even know what is real at this point fuck everything,1,suicidal

474,Is suicide worth it?,hi im 15 years old currently been pulled out of schooldue to many reasons which is why im here so that i can clear my mind of any other thoughts that may lead me to things that i might regret later on id like to share first my story so that no one would come at meex youre just 15 its just a phase pls stop doing this to get attentionetc when i was very young i didnt really paid any attention whenever my father and mother would fought or when my sister the 2nd oldest would always ignore or would get pissed at me because i thought that it was the norm but things got worse when the whole family fought because of the shtty things my father had done and it all started because of me drinking a goddmn cola it went like this who drank the cola my father asked i was very scared so i didnt replied he asked that again and again until my mother told my father off until they just started to shout at each other which forced my eldest sister to butt in and the whole thing went to what my father did such as adultery and abuse so it lead to my father pushing my mother which pushed my sisters to fight my father physically i couldnt do anything but it really shocked me and blamed myself for it after the whole ordeal it took 5 months to mend back the family i thought finally but i still had other problemsto face i know that its stereotypical of me to say this but my asian parentsfilipino would always forced me to study when i never wanted any of this i just wanted to play with other kids with no care in the world but i couldnt my mothers way of teaching really left a toll on me cuz she would just hit me whenever i get the wrong answer or if i couldnt reply with the correct answer ive always been the 2nd honor roll but when she said this to me on the way back home pls dont drop your grades it would be really embarassing to my friends if you did that was jusy painful for me others may think that im overreacting it was still really painful tho i still couldnt speak my mind i continued still i was getting bullied as well for no reason years went by i was already in my first year of highschool in a prestige academy i made friends been respected and i had little bumps in my grades but i still felt really great then one day one of my friends who is a guy told me to hang out with him i couldnt tell that he had malicious intents i was just really stupid he cornered me can i touch your boobs he said i was shocked and refused but he was really strong and managed to touched me and resorted to attempted rape afte i broke free crying and running in the same day i couldnt tell anyone nor my parent so i just cried the whole night and proceeded to go to school and bearing to be with him in the same class i had finally mustered up the courage to tell the guidance councelor and due to that he got expelled and words got out because of the things he did and so i got harassed even more with the guys but i couldnt do anything and told myself to bear with it i now entered my 2nd year of highschool which started the changes with me i became more irritated a hot mess ive been disrespectful to my mom the reason we fight every morning and another problem rosed up a mistress of my father contacted me i knew that she was just messing with me but i felt so angry so i told my guidance counselor because i didnt know what to do anymore so she told my mom and filed a case to my dads mistress but the case got dropped because they said the account iwas fake when clearly it wasnt i know im no professional but it was pretty obvious that it wasnt fake i got even more mad because my mom didnt mind and told me it must be  gods plan im christian but im not really on how my mother believesnow things really went downhill for mei couldnt eat i couldnt think of happy thoughts i  would just think of nothing or everything is just useless even humanity and that i wished i could just sleep and die from it things got even worse because my sisterthe 2nd eldest whenever i tell her shes wrong she would get mad at mewhenever i got mad at her she would get made at me even tho she was in the wrong but she was too prideful and wouldnt say sorry but i still did anyway when things got even more hectic i started to hurt myself my mom knew and told me angrily that i did it because of the internet i couldnt take it anymore everything that i do is wrong  its like im the misfortune i wanted to kill myself which is why i went to the guidance counselor and told my mom everything so she pulled me out of school and appointed me to a psychiatrist but the medicines was too much for me in short it was painful and it makes me go insane for some reason and even messed with my dietmade me eat more so my mom stopped me from drinking the pills but the withdrawal was shtty too i still get mad at everything and i really want to kill myself i mean i dont know im still thinking of the pros and cons of me killing myself its just that i wish in my sleep someone would kill me but i really wanna know if suicide is worth a shot because i regret everything and im desperate this isnt the whole thing sthst happened but its getting long

651,Can I say I have a mental health condition to an employer even if I haven't been diagnosed?,hello i am certain that i have been suffering from anxiety and depression for a number of years as a result i completely withdrawn myself from society but the end of last year it was time for me to get a job try and put myself back out there and hopefully make myself live bit more comfortably and maybe give myself a chance of recovering life in my late 20s i also believe i have dypraxia as i have difficulty talking to people in certain situations but i have complete fluency in othershowever having got this job im experiencing a number of things of which i have experienced in every role since i have been working and that is people are quick to jump to conclusions and this isnt me being paranoid this is an accumulation of experiences that are similar for me and i know what will happen in a few months ill be the most hated person at that job and everyday i go they will most likely give me hellcan i say i have a mental health condition to my employer if i havent been diagnosed i dont really want them to personally attack me every time i enter a new workplace because i would like a chance of living too why are people so quick to assess one another then give them hell because one person front talk properly i really needed a job which is why i never said anything about a mental health condition as i believe this would have almost certainly affected my chances what should i do because if i dont do anything then i know what will happen during this adventure of employment i will have to leave because of comments and accusations that arent true something doesnt seem right there also i know there is something wrong because hardly want to talk to anyone nowadays i have no friends out of choice as an example i dreamt of working very insular jobs growing up well may as well kill myself because no one can help they can give me placebos but they wont give me the one thing which will cure depression and other mental illnesses in an instant but they cant give me the job i wanted to do with my life so tell me what is the point thank you for reading and your time because it really wasnt worth it,0,depression

699,Feeling below average,this feeling comes and goes and i usually keep it suppressed by submerging myself in mundane stuff i am 34 years old and i have been dealing with these episodes of worthlessness since probably middle school i grew up in a small rural town in puerto rico i cant say we all know each other but everyone knows everyone elses business i  grew up in a  strict pentecostal family with many rules forced into my siblings and i we used to go to church usually 7 days a week and on sundays twice bible school in the morning and afternoonevening service  secular music was prohibited and any tv material that was deemed demonic by the pastor of course living in a pentecostal family made a huge impact on who i was from elementary school all the way until i decided to part ways with the faith later on in my 20s i was so insecure about myself and tried super hard to fit in with the other kids it was a challenge because i never felt understood by the others mainly because i had nothing to relate with them i was not allowed to listen to secular music or even go to the movies because of rules my mom enforced on all of us that insecurity grew even stronger when entered high school which of course was the worse years of my teenage years there were so many things happening in my life at that moment that i thought in some weird way it was all normal during the last years of elementary school my dad decided to distance himself from church he became an alcoholic shortly after and everything went downhill from there he multiple affairs that my mom was ware of and that didnt turned out well for me my mom became aggressive and depressed i used to get hit for no reason that i can remember to this dayi think she felt trapped because divorcing my father was not an option due to her fanaticism my mom used to break stuff every day scream and yell stayed inside her room all day and praying for the most part one positive thing i can say about her is that we were never hungry and somehow she always found ways to provide us with clothes and food my dad disappeared for many months one time and i thought he gave up on us but specially on me i felt so betrayed by him my mom was also nonpresent in my life or school my grades dropped drastically and i was bullied a lot at school for being alone the majority of the time there is so much to say about everything that happened but i thought i was over that and everything that happened today i am angry at my parents because how irresponsible they were with their kids i compare myself to every one else around me and i feel like i shouldve had a better upbringing i know its up to me know and they are no longer responsible but it still hurts me so much i deal with my insecurities every day and that is something im never gonna be able to change i compare myself a lot with everyone  i tend to feel like a way lesser version of whoever i am comparing myself to im going to therapy and that helps to a degree i just wish i could find people or at least someone that can relate to this if you read this far thanks and i apologize for the typos or grammar errors ill do my best to fix them later,0,depression

706,I dont know if its worth the read but this is my life this is how i feel and if you do read it can you answer the question at the end. thank you,im writing this because ive just once again thought about killing myself but this isnt even within the first 100 times i have thought of suicide from a young age id say roughly around age 1112 i first thought of just ending it i even remember how i sat at a window ledge looked down and just bathed in the moment before climbing back down with tears coming down my face because i wasnt strong enough to wow well i bet that sounded crazy i wasnt strong enough to kill myself a direct contradiction of what strength is but a las i and any other who has felt how i feel will relate so about me of course you must be wondering how did he get this fucked up what has happened well im going to let you all know just in case once day i do get my strength i am one of 10 children slotting in at number 7 i have been emotionally and physically abused by those who were supposed to nourish me heres whats different though so not only did they make my life hell they controlled my life where i was and what i was doing to the extent that i couldnt even make my own decisions on the little things and still cant things i have been beaten for just so you get the vibe  as a child i would pee in my sleep so i would be woken up by a belt hitting my body  as all kids do i would fall asleep on the sofa watching tv so i would be woken up with a belt hitting my body  i once told my dad there was no point in doing something again because nothing was good enough for him to which i was beaten with a metal pole until i could no longer use my arms to defend my self and just took blows to the head dripping blood all over the houseto summarise i have been fucked upbut im trying to figure out how and when this all started at what point did i become the person i am now afraid insecure manipulative and untrustworthy i give myself these attributes because thats all i really am i am afraid of the world horrified possibly i have ran out of classes in fucking uni because i felt as if everyone was looking on me i have this crippling feeling that everyone is always looking at me insecure lol i dont even know what to say i have deleted everything on my social medias multiple times purely because the anxiety of someone giving a fuck enough to look at them and then the possibility of them finding my pictures funny gives me so much anxiety that id prefer them not be there am i manipulative yes but i dont understand how one can not be manipulative i like to have things my way of course we all do but i know how to get it done i know how to get responses out of people or to get people to do what i want because i had to learn to im one of fucking 10 children and i showed up in the middle and this wasnt no brady bunch happy family shit this was controlling abusive and manipulative and i guess thats what i became you are a product of your environment after all i dont really know the purpose or direction of this as i have just stopped crying again its 213pm and decided fuck it imma do this so if i do kms at least maybe one mfer can know what i been trying to sayso guys i think im going crazy this is a new development if you dont mind me starting here i sit in my room and talk to myself inside my head for hours a day full on conversations guess this is what happens when you dont get to train social skills sometimes i cry sometimes i get so angry i dont even know what to do and sometimes admittedly i feel straight up heart broken as if i have been done a disservice by the world and unfairly i was born into one family instead of another i fantasize too much and i kind of sorta relate to people from netflix series like joe the stalker i get it bro you just want to feel a solid love that aint going no where and youll do anything to keep that but in turn you require a few things loyalty being one of them fortunately i can say i dont relate to him with his killing that would just be another burden in my head to drive me crazier instead when my heart is broken people just kick the pieces to side and move on fuuuuuuck im really not good at structuring things i writeok i think the logical thing to do is start with little stories from childhood and work my way to present day i was born in 1998 in africa and moved to the united kingdom at a young age not sure how young because i dont remember my dad had been previously married and had 5 children from his first wife and at this time only 3 from my mum me and my 2 brothers one a year older one a year younger its said that when i was born they thought i was a fucked up baby i was going to be disabled or something of the sorts not in a doctor said it way but like i was born and they looked at me and said na this aint it way and little would you know my little brother was born just under 10 months later fantastic way to start life so we all lived in one house when we first got to the uk very vague memory of this shit by the way combination of what ive been told as fact and what i know to be true so as a kid i have been described as a quiet and timid kid so quiet infact that my older brother and sister age 1214 from a different mother would pinch me or hit me to make me cry because when i would cry it was funny that i would make no noise  i was also a huge fan of lion king asking them to watch it multiple times a day with me everyday we then moved a couple times memory all blurry and we arrived at the next destination that i remember we lived in a flat in a small town in england for a couple years my memories of this place are my   constantly injuring himself severly by playing out dbz toonami vegeta and ps2 i was a normal kid but i would get fucked up by my dad btw im around 46 years old i still remember the time i was called downstairs just to be beaten i think for drawing a rude picture that was discovered after i had just been beaten boom boom not too much going on just the entrance to a life of suffering but not too much tbh  we then moved to a council house elsewhere just kids and mum because dad had decided its stressful to live with people so hed rather pay 1k rent elsewhere for his own place then help his family these years werent too bad though if anything they were my favourite because he wasnt around it was just us 3 years in that place from year 2 year 5 he would still drive down though on occasion just to hit us and then return to his home on the flip side of the uk this was fantastic for my personal growth of course as i learnt that being a father means coming over shouting and arguing with your wife beating your children and then cutting and by beating i mean sure we were between ages 7810 but he would hit us with all he had leave belt marks for days all over my body to the extent the neighbours would hear us screaming and would then mock us the next day as we walked to school he then thought that we were becoming bad children at the time me and all my siblings were top in our classes thanks to our mum keeping us up to study with her  as well as this at this age we started being forced to go to mosque mon fri 57 and then over the weekends we would go to arabic school and if we were at home we would play outside in the park so i dont know how bad we could of really been but who knowsshe was in college so while she did her homework she helped us with ours actually with that being said i would steal from my mum not a lot and not everyday but a pound or 2 here and there just because everyone else in school could afford to buy things like sweets and toys and i would never be able to join in because i had none i would come home from school and mums not in so id have to sit outside the house for a couple hours people would walk by but i had no friends house to go to like my brothers so i would just sit at the door and wait my life has been hell maybe its easy from an outside view to say naa aint that bad but try live it everyday you come home aint no body even in by the time everyone does get in its all at once no time for you and mum to talk no dad asking how was school bruh go to  sleep to summarize though i was studying everyday 7 days a week and still being beaten along with my brothers but i had a newly born sister and it was time for the move to the big city so fuck it maybe its about to get betterbruh i forgot and now remembered this nigga would look all 3 of us in the garage for whole days just because and the punishment for leaving would be you get beat and thrown back in there think about the mentally how much that would fuck you up you aint even fucking 10 yetwhen we first got to this new city we were quick to discover its rough out there day one we were robbed they were no more parks we could just go to play at so now i became and indoors kid to go along with that now my dad didnt live too far away he was only in the neighbouring town so instead of monthly visits it was now weekly fair enough to say within a year i had put on i dont know 10 maybe 15kg i was fat af going into year 7 but in year 6 i was a very thin framed kid i was depressed and im not sure if i knew it but my life consisted of go to school and be bullied to come home and be beaten not knowing where my safe place was i chose solitude i learnt out of sight out of mind didnt even work all the time but nigga i tried my mum became pregnant again this was not necessary but ive grown to love the child so now they are soon to be 5 kids and none of which already receive and adequate amount of love just to further paint the character of my father he beat my younger sister who was at the time maybe 34 because she took and hid his phone later revealed he left it in his jacket pocket no apology has ever been given ever in history for a mistaken beating we spent little time in that house but what do ire member being dragged from under a bed to be beaten and being beaten nearly every morning without fail for 12  years for bed wetting punches were not pulled   we moved again after same sort of thing really hed show up for a few days fuck up everyones mood and cut no one wanted him around but no body would say because everyone was afraid of getting beat again this is the house i lived in when i decided ahh man maybe this life thing isnt for me went and sat at the window ledge in my room 3rd floor looking down and wished i could just let go we would be locked in the attic this time the door is genuinely locked we couldnt get out if we wanted room was what 3x4 meters storage room basically and 3 of us had been locked in there for the whole day living in such circumstances created bitch nigga behaviour amongst us as brothers because the beatings were bad you did not want to be beaten it would fuck your whole shit up so niggas started snitching bruh my own brother came in my room while i was learning to beat my meat took my phone took pictures of what i was watching and then showed everyone while i was sat in the living room i was then promptly beaten this the environment i grew up in even in your own fucking room you couldnt do shit you couldnt trust nobody and you were very likely going to be fucked up for anything you did this could include but was not limited to holding your brothers hand while fighting thats gay apparently so you would be beaten defending yourself to your parents its rude to speak back so i was beaten not speaking its rude to not speak when spoken to so i was beaten finishing the milk bruh imagine your 12 year old hungry self wanted some cereal finished it and then gone beaten for it that was my fucking life id go to school this fat unloved ugly kid i think this is a good time to point out i went to a bad school in a white neighbour hood and as we all know aint nothing scarier than poor white people jk but those guys were harsh to me day one of highschool i had a fight why because i was being racially abused i was constantly racially abused i was not even accepted by my own race because i wasnt black enough i am quarter white 3 quated black so skin color dark brown meant i was a paki i was an indian i was a terrorist osama bin laden was my uncle so on and so forth aint no body ever gave a shit about me not a single teacher not no body and this is where things get fucked up for me this when i started doing dumb shit i started being a prick to my friends not fully understanding what was even going on but just thinking out of i gotta cover my back i gotta make sure i aint no punk but in reality it made me into a punk but ill get to that later i still remember everything nice people have ever said to me that i felt was said genuinely though once the most popular kid in school told me to not let anyone pick on me and just tell them im not asian although i had tried both i felt his sincerity and very much appreciated it and still think about it to this day i wanna fast forward now to year 11 when shit really hits the fan i moved to a school which was mixed gender years 710 i was in a boy school and the introduction of women had definitely caught my eyes hadnt seen them in many years since everyday was school mosque home runescape repeat maaaaaaaaaan fuck that shit thats the worst childhood and to make it better slide a couple hundred beatings in over those 3 years and now you might be beginning to get a grasp on who i am as a person of course they are little moments when things workout but not really to summarise i was in love or atleast i felt like i was i did horribly on my exams which at the time i accreted to me just focusing my time on her and not myself and that started the downwards spiral my little brother told my parents i wasnt fasting at prom i have not ever fasted a day since pretty sure i gave up on religion a long time ago but thats its own thing and i was beaten then locked in the house so i could not attend my final meeting for ncs i had saved up my 5 a week for 10 weeks to pay the 50 to go and now i just couldnt imagine that feeling i was going to finally be away from this whole home all summer and now i couldnt why because my dad who had now moved in full time had decided to spite me  the summer of finishing high school of enjoyment had arrived my plans to be with my friends had been put to a halt my plans of going to a top 3 college in the city had been put to a halt my summer was instead me just sitting in my room everyday the whole summer alone not talking to anyone for multiple days at a time this is when my solitude became serious i became an awkward nervous rek after this i couldnt even talk to people properly without overthinking everything id say if summer was 10 days long i was beaten on 67 days as well so yh torture house and to make it better i had no friends because we moved so fucking much i didnt know a single person and couldnt get to know them because we lived in a jewish neighbour hood and if youve ever lived in one as the only black muslim family you aint going to have no friend but yh returned to college and it was ok except for everyday i would come home and be locked out of my house everyday without fail my dad would sit in the kitchen looking out the window and laugh at me having nowhere else to go so i would sit in the gardens storage cupboard nothing much at all probably just a big wardrobe but it was dry i would then go to college and repeat this process day by day mentally exhausting my self little by little more once again through in beatings on4 out of every 10 days and you have the image of what my first year of college was like my parents decided as a family we should read the quran together muslim people book not all of it like a page each a day so i read my page and left and while i was goning upstairs i heard him talking about me so i decided ah im probably going to be beaten let me stay here and wait so i did and soon enough i heard him say why did he read that page he read that a few days ago hes looking for the easy ones so my mum said ill call him back down and he can read again i was called  come downstairs and read again and i replied whats the point nothing i do is good enough for him anyway to which he responded by walking into the kitchen getting a metal pole and coming to hit me with it the best bit for him it was a detached house so no one could even hear my screams at first i tried to block with my left arm and then i just couldnt hold it up anymore so i switched to the right and the same happened so then i was just lying there being beaten by my dad with a metal pole bleeding all over the floor from my head and when he thought he was done he left this day is the day i lost my shit as soon as i could stand i went and grabbed a knife but was stopped by my mother i always found it funny how she would always come to stop me but never him i then called the police when they arrived they was so much blood on the ground floor corridor that she threw shoes over to hide it because it could not be cleaned while he sat there on the sofa smug knowing he had gotten away with it my mum had hidden me from the police and that was that another great day in the life i had become sick of it and told my mum i do not care what she thinks i am tired and i am leaving i will go to foster care if i must but i am not dealing with this shit anymore i dont know if its important but i was also 17 without a phone or laptop or any communication with the outside world if i was in my room all day i was playing badminton against the wall staring at the ceiling or creating fantasies in my mind to rescue me from where i was currently i told her ill get a job just received ni number ill figure it out for myself and what did she doshe said nothing for maybe a month and then we were moving house so she came in one morning and just told me we are moving pack up so i did thinking we are moving away from that cunt and she had chosen me her son over her manipulative controlling abusive husband instead she had rented another place and just dropped me off there would come round maybe every month or 2 for an hour or so and that was my life now i was completely secluded and this was the first time i actually tried to kill myself i had a panic attack the anxiety just got to me i took all my sleeping pills at once and boom i woke up the next day they were all fucking natural herbal things and they couldnt do shit bummer i know she still doesnt know about this i continued thinking about killing my self shit i never stopped from that first time till now but it was just thoughts and ideas i had finally tried to and failed instead i started smoking weed which would help sometimes but other times like i learnt the hardway it would make me think about my life and whats actually happened and compare it to my peers around me and i would breakdown crying my life has no direction i have no family around me which is ironic in a family of 133 parents 10 kidsbecause we had all been tormented soo much we didnt know to look out for eachother we had to look out for our selves first this is why im selfish i cant afford to not be because if im not my own number 1 in terms of in a greedy way like if i dont look out for me first no one else will my mum then told me she didnt want to continue paying for where i lived and i had to find somewhere else now that i was 1819 which is a real bitch because if i had just done what i wanted to years back and left this family of suffering i would have been alright but instead now im going to college everyday thinking about where tf am i going to live so i dropped out of college to work i ended up returning to college having to restart living in a city different to the one i studied in working night shifts to then go straight in to class but i figured it out got to uni and guess what i dont know what the fuck is going on everyone is social and i dont know how to socialise sometimes i feel as though i stand out so badly that im just not supposed to be there im surrounded by people who life has blessed people who have seen the world people whos parents love them soo much that they even come to watch them train at uni in my whole fucking life there has never been a single thing ive done which i can say i looked into the crowd and had a single person there to support me instead i have been told to dream is free ive been told your not going to make anything with your life and you are going to be a failure honestly i have accepted these as truths now i dont even feel like myself anymore i feel stupid as if i took a couple too many hits to the head information doesnt sink in properly anymore im embarraced in class because everyone else knows what they are doing to some level i have no fucking idea everyone else goes home for christmas or there family comes to visit loool my family dont give a single fuck i am alone in this world tired depressed and ready to go i accepted death a little while back one night i was lying in bed crying and realised i dont have to deal with this anymore i really dont i have accepted i will kill myself and i am just waiting for the day in which i get my final little nudge to step of the ledgei just want to be at peacei also had a girlfriend for a while she cheated on me so i stopped valuing her as a person and just kept her for the other stuff she even got pregnant and aborted it im 20ampx200bquestion am i crazy for feeling like this and if you were in my shoes do you think you would feel the same or different,1,suicidal
707,"My life story, I am sorry it's so long",hi there to all witches who take their craft seriously and really work i am very deperate and on the brink of killing myself there is so much to life this i know unfortunately for me every door every option every opertunity has been closed off for me since i was born before i say what i came here to ask heres alittle backstorybackstory  throughout my moms pregnancy the doctors were absolutely sure i was to be born a healthy baby girl but somewhere along the line something unexpected happened and i came out not only a boy according to what ive been told and whats written on my birth certificate i was also unfortunate enough to be born with cleft lip cleft palette asthma droopy eyesdont know if thats the clinical term but basically up until i was 8 or 10 cant remember i was unable to open my eyes all the way and various other problems i have always felt like i should not have been born a boy let alone live past 3 weeks another failed diagnosis lucky me right my childhood consisted of doing stuff to get attention but really all i wanted was to be liked a very hard thing to do when you are basically physically retarded and cannot talk like everyone else and constantly being reminded how you are such a failer that you couldnt even be born right since my conciousness first made its way into this world i have found myself thinking as a girl along with thinking how much better litterally my life would have been if i managed to get it right my dad was never in the picture so growing up without a father has been difficult on its own but of course i was informed my dad had the chance to come to america when i was born because of my condition but he declined to start a new family and im sure he had other reasons my mom always worked all the time so it was pretty much me and my older brother for some time an older brother that constantly made fun of me along with my mom for how i talked and how i acted my brother constantly calling me gay faggot bitch you name it hes done it im sure he was unaware of how i felt inside but it traumatized me so much i am afraid of being myself my body is not shaped how normal guys are either so i have no idea how to take that problem at school o was labeled the retarded kid no one likedonce i turned 11 my mom met a man lets call him d d wasis military and i later found out they got married quick span of a few months to finance my surgeries because i came from a background of poverty being single parent with 2 kids later 3 i was always treated like a pet and always had the harshest and most frequent punishments i was always forced to do everything for everybody else my brother had to go do something like talk to a neighbor to get the bike fixed i had to do it stuff like that to this day i get asked by family to buy their plane tickets or order them stuff cause they dont know how i have always been used all my life i am nothing but a tool as i patiently waited for the surgeries that i was supposed to get atleast just the one to fix my nose and make me look somewhat normal when i was 12 then delayed to 16 then 18 and finally at 19 i received the first surgery and all they did was make my life a living hell medical history  the doctor messed up my nose and now theres a glasses size gap on the bridge of my nose for the tip of it they put cartalage from my side which they lied to me and took it out of under my right chest is fat which i didnt even care about having in the first place i just wanted my nose to be straight and deal with the rest later i was put in a maxillary distractor fancy name for cage on my head to move my upper jaw forward so that they can reconstruct the palate roof of my mouth and straighten jaw or whatever they were doing i have no clue and it seemed unnessesary to me it did however improve my speech just a tiny bit i had to wear this crap o my head for 4 months later i then made my own appointments 2 years later 22 and got a surgery for bonegraft i am still missing the tooth implant which i cannot afford nor will i ever be able to and i have to have another surgery on my nose again i have always suffered from depression because of this but not only because of my unfortunate medical circumstances also i have been getting pains around my abdominal area so either ive got something going on down there that shouldnt be or when i was born the doctors decided it be best to stick a penis on me and call me a boyas for the other reasons why im highly depressed and on the verge of collapsing i was forced by my stepdad to go into debt i wanted to go to college but i wanted to do it like everyone else a real place surrounded by real people so i can maybe make atleast one friend and not be a total failer of course my luck hits home again and he forced me to go to an online college with the promiss of letting me use the money the army provides to him for school use i agree and then he turns and days yea no do it yourself landing me 16k debt that i cant pay 3k i was forced to pay just to get my diploma and 3k my mom was forced to pay for me to be able to enroll in classes before this though i was planning to join the military to get a one up on life but apparently not gods plan since when i brought up the idea he straight refused i was not allowed to work or go out i did not have an allowance or any type of money except money i got for my birthday 20 every year ages 181920 and it didnt help that i had no friends up until senior year in highschool that summer is the only happy memories i have after leaving my home town he was very controlling thats why i feel i cant do anything without the constant reminder of all the trauma ive facedi did however keep the promis i made to myself about joining the military unfortunately though i was not let in after two years of waiting and providing all of the medical paperwork i was finally sent to meps for the marines finally a chance for me to straighten out my life and man up and get all these rediculous thoughts and feelings out my head nope once i get there i take the asvap and score on the higher side i know right smarts actually came in handy i might look like a retard but my mental capacity is on the higher side scored 80 go through medical everything good up until the physical the doctor asks me if i always been tall and skinny i have a very feminine body besides the lack of breasts and having a penis i say yes normal ok cool then i go to the eye exam and they tell me i have astigmatism in my left eye this i knew it happened when i was about 5 or so started hallucinating and seeing giant spiders with extream detail i went to see if i can get this fixed they said and i quote the damage to your eye is so savire that we do not have the equipment required to even make a dent of progress the best solution i can offer is to use the effected eye and hope it gets better over time sorry but there is nothing we can do for you at this time  lasik doctor so dream job at marines  no go the meps people tell me to try the army cause they accept pretty much anyone i do and same thing they say i cant join because of my stupid eye gee thanks god at this point i start thinking maybe its not meant to be and give up my job history is halarious atleast to me almost even didnt get hired first job at age 20 mcdonalds mom gets a house with my brother who got to live my fantasy of being in the military and travel the world who then decides to mock me and make my life even worse by deciding he needs a surgery on his penis he thought it was so curved he cant have sex yet he never tried now hes depressed and thinks he can never have it and the doctor messed up doctor also gave him circomsition this happened during my attempt at joining the marines throughout the course of 6 months he would constantly scream at the top of his lungs and say how god hates him this is punishment lash out at me for no reason and make me feel not only unsafe but want to take my own life even more just to get out of that situation once we move into the new house this continues along with me every day for months on end calming him down explaining and telling him to be patient cause its not gunna heal right away and healing of the body depends on the mind state anyways because of the move i am forced to quit my job that i actually enjoyed to transfer to another mcdonalds on the side of town we moved to two towns down i work there for 6 months before quitting because of how unfairly i was being treated everything was my fault i never did anything right i was lazy the works even though i did mainly everybodys job in the kitchen everyday i washed the grill swept mopped multiple times a day i would be on grill then on the table making the burgers id go and get the 50 pound boxes from the freezer you name it i did it i eventually quit after 6 months bought a one way ticket to california and said my goodbyes to my brother who called my mom crying saying i left and he tried to stop me i was sick of his shit i had shit i was dealing with all my life and now i have to deal with you and your problem too excuse the langauge but fuck outta here with that shit i have so little control over my own life that i only spent 2 days in california before my mom told the entire family where i was and got my aunt grandmas sister so technically grandma whos also a nun to somehow convince me to go to new york and stay with my uncle i cant believe i actually fell for their stupid guilt trip but somehow after only 5 days i was off to nyc i told myself its probably best since there are lots of opportunities for me to be a musican wrong i was basically plummited into the same exact situation with different people greedy money hungry aunt no jobs no money an uncle who works at night sleeps durring the day wierd daughter that turned into her mother i had to get outta there it got to the point where she was looking through my stuff while i wasnt there to find proof i could pay her 700 to stay in the shitty stinky room they kept rabbits in with a door that locks from the outside and a broken window very small room at that after two months of looking for jobs while making music simaltaniously i am being called a liar i good for nothing a lazy bum you name it thats what she labeled me i manage to get a job at mcdonalds again but in ny i manage to set up the bonegraft appointment and lay on an air mattress for two weeks feeling useless and being called useless i go back to work and then move into my grandpas room he was renting lucky for me he was on vacation for the next two months durring this time when my granpa came back j felt obligated and wanted to help with his bills ultimately giving him what little i had 4 months pass and after much consideration and mombrother begging for me to come back i oblige i then get a job at another mcdonalds in the next town over oppisate direction with the help of my old boss i work there for 6 months before quitting because of the same drama the first time and hearing people continuously talking shit about me making me feel terrible about myself even more and with the emense parinoia i was experiencing due to smoking too much the parinoia was about how i hid the fact im not normal and that i wish to be a girl and intricate details of my lifeif you think thats it well your wrong my aunt comes to the usa on a visa and is put in a shit situation feeling unsafe according to her my mom is the only one in the usa she knows mom folds and buys her a plane ticket to stay here for the time being money my mom didnt have which is fine desperate times desperate measures and such she stays here for an entire month and quickly realises there is nothing here everything is far and you have to drive everywhere the time that she was here i could have used to work on my music the 3 hours i was left alone in the house but no everything that she bought or well made me buy she complains and says its for someone else complains she didnt buy anything for herself and how she had to use my moms clothes cause instead of buy things for herself she bought for everyone else supposedly she then says how she needs a phone and makes me go find one for her after i go through the trouble of finding and iphone 7 plus for a crazy deal 150 which they usually go for 300350 i go and i borrow money to go get her the phone she then says oh i wanted a more modern onelike yours im like ugh ok i reset mine give her it and she then says she will give me the 150 my phone was iphone x pristine condition months pass i still dont have a job stopped looking to focus on getting my licence everybody keeps making excuses not to teach me and the piece of crap car that my brother was going to pass down to me needs a new battery so i cant use it and he also decided to retract the offer before i got the chance to use it and is selling it because he doesnt want to pay for

735,My Story (depressed steroid user),hey after much meditation i decided to create this post both as therapy for myself and to open up a forum of conversation i am writing this right before i go to work so i will probably edit it later so here it goes i apologize in advance for my rambling i am currently 20 years old and a sophomore  in college a few minutes ago i typed in im eventually going to kill myself into google trying to find some forum post to read lo and behold an rsuicidewatch post came up from 3 years ago which led to me creating my reddit account to make this postthroughout my life so far i have struggled from a crippling loneliness i was mostly a loner in middle school and high school one of those arrogant assholes who only care about grades etc inside however i had a crippling insecurity about my body image i have a distinct memory from when i was perhaps 1011 of staring into the mirror and looking at my face critiquing every last bit to those i know this would not make much sense as i have always been told that i am very attractive i have never seen it however my phone to this day is filled with photos that i have taken of myself deep down i think that my depression is mostly of a natural physiological basis up until i was 18 i had never even held a girls hand and up to now i have only kissed one a very pretty italian girl who left the country soon after i have spent most of the last 2 years listening to sad songs driving aimlessly chain smoking and watching movies like her and manchester by the sea luckily enough i do have a best friend that i met in hs who struggles with depression as well he however has no problem picking up girls do to his charisma that he has developed over the years as a coping mechanism together we mostly drink smoke weed and watch films i always make it a point to get drunk or high enough that my entire life past and future flashes before me in a sort of slideshow as i write this i have been using steroids on and off for 25 years i first started after losing 25 pounds mostly by starving myself and then developing an ok physique i thought that nothing else would make me attractive so i made the decision to buy testosterone enanthate off the darknet when i was 17 i didnt give a shit if i died because in my mind there was no other way to find a girl to fill the void inside of me now i am very muscular 510 190 around 10 bf yet my void is not filled and i dont think it ever will be i am on a solid trajectory right now and will inherit a large sum from my grandfather when i turn 25 this adds no meaning to my life however i see myself as a sort of holden caulfield or amory blaine from this side of paradise all i want to do is help people and be loved but i have a crippling fear that i will only feel loved vicariously by watching movies and reading books i cant shake the feeling that i wont make it past 40 before i eventually kill myself my father is currently slowly dying of alcoholism from his depression at 50 just as his father didevery time i think of this i am taken back to a memory from when i was a senior in hs i had been talking to a girl for a month or two and my best friend had hid the fact that he was having sex with her i had never felt so inadequate in my life i drove home crying and tied my belt around the doorknob and leaned forward thankfully i didnt follow through with it this inadequacy still consumes me i just want hope that someday these feelings will subside,1,suicidal

811,An ode to grief,i just made a journal entry and i thought i could share it to see if it helps anyone going through grief stages theres something that happens to a person when a piece of your soul passes away you realize that youre in denial all this time that something you never thought you would want becomes something you realized you pushed away into the ignorant side of your mind so you wouldnt think about it so yes a part of my soul is gone and ive been trying to numb that pain that is beyond any kind of description i feel like i had something precious that was ripped out of my hands and lit on fire to burn something that was alive and part of me burned and i could feel that slow painful burn like watching someone you love get tortured by some unknown entity this results in the stages of grief theres denial which i already had since i was a child i grew up in ignorant bliss not wanting to acknowledge what i knew was true the there was anger this nasty creature that you create to get back at whatever hurt you and it will literally drive you mad crazy trying to show others how much someone hurt you trying to find something called closure  which by the way is the only fairytale or myth that you will ever hear closure is the only thing in the world that is impossible now youre stuck in this miserable monster you wonder how youll escape alive and some never do im sorry for the ones who were the center of my anger and unclearity you did not deserve what i gave you from my period of griefthen you bargain for the sake of whatever sanity you may have left you bargain for hope freedom and whatever else that you have its not a lot but regardless you bargain just the same you try to find people who will help and love you unconditionally then you realize that they cant enable the grief anymore than you can youre left alone again wondering who the hell you have become because it just isnt you anymore youve become this sad and hopeless mess of a person the people you love love you so much they cant take your struggling any more that you can thats when your soul dies a little morethen there is depression thats there through yall of the stages that feeling of no motivation no life its an empty void but filled with all the feeling mentioned prior depression makes you remember your not the only one you are made of many sad and hurting people who just want some sort of clarity they just question every day  why what can i do why am i feeling these things this makes you wonder if your feelings are even ok to feel supposedly there is acceptance i have not gotten there yet most with depression havent good luck to all of us this is that bridge that we have not crossed and some myself are very afraid to cross it it means that we will be ok and sometimes thats really scary because we dont always know how to feel ok anymore we have the beautiful loved ones that have been there no matter what they want our success and happiness a deep part of our soul wants that too the part that is still alive we forget that part dont we my beautiful friends there is a soul in our bodies one that has not been ripped away one that cannot be taken from an ugly thing such as grief every day that we are here together lets reach out to the part of our soul that has survived and let us remember that we are more than our grief and sufferingjust expressing feelings and open to input,0,depression

873,My story (incomplete),similar story here op in my case my dad spent my childhood promising to help me pursue a science career if i moved in with him along with many other exorbitant promises he then coaxed me into signing my life savings over to him under the guise of him teaching me money management skills afterwards his personality instantly changed like he had been replaced with a body snatcherhe started holding my money hostage to control me he forced me into a flat earth fundamentalist church he started incessantly discouraging my scientific interests i was forbidden from me from even being seen with a girl since it might lead others to think we were sexually active he threatened to cut me off if i ever associated with members of so many demographics that i was functionally unable to have friends he would scream at me and belittle and humiliate me for hours every day his church was so strict that i had to give up most of my hobbies for being sinful he tried to damage my relationships with all of my other family members he would constantly follow me around and would incessantly act out for attention so much that i struggled to even attempt my schoolwork or even my remaining hobbies i was quickly so psychologically broken that i started failing my classes despite growing up an honors student a few years later i took on a second major hoping to raise my gpa and just barely squeak into grad school dad took this to somehow mean that i was on the verge of graduating with two phds he completely flipped from incessantly discouraging me to exerting 247 pressure to graduate with those two phds immediately i explained over and over that i wasnt getting two phds but he wouldnt accept it despite my protests he spread word far and wide about my two phds and i gained a reputation as some kind of miracle prodigy that i could never actually live up to by this point dad was in the final stages of terminal heart problems and was so relentless in his pressure that i started going along with it because even after all his years of lies and abuse i didnt want to disappoint him on his death bedyears went by and things continued to get worse for me i was overwhelmed with preemptive grief over dads impending death every day i went through a traumatic religious deconversion and lost my soulsustaining nonfundamentalist faith in god i started experiencing severe diabetes symptoms i was struggling with the increased course load and failing to recover my grades as dad continued to sink deeper and deeper into an obsession with those completely imaginary phds one day dad started taking me to visit some old man from his crazy cult who was bedridden from his own terminal heart problems more years went by and both dad and the old guy were both alive that meant that dad had been in the final stages of terminal illness for something like 6 years i realized that he had been outrageously exaggerating his health problems and that i had spent the last several of them going along with his delusional nonsensefuck it im tired it hurts so much it hurts so much,1,suicidal

946,Can I leave some baggage here,im not sure if this is the place to post this but here we go apologies in advance this is going to be all over the place im on mobile and im lost not real names this is a throw away etc etc etcokay so im 22 m i guess ive been dealing with depression for about 8 years i have anxiety  im self conscious and i like to believe im more fucked up than i actually am and if its okay here id like to get it off my chest and talk about my life and where i am now to no one in particulari was never the popular kid i was known but never popular i was the kid that got picked last for sports or games never got to play soccer with the other kids because i wasnt good enough wasnt included in tag or hide and go seek but i pressed on not knowing what the other kids were bullying me i got to play lego or slap jack tic tac toe you name it i played by myself i had about 3 or 4 friends for most of primary school kindergartengrade 3 not knowing how to interact with the other kids i was lonely i didnt realize i was lonely as it was well normal for me the world was out to get me and i let it i had no voice i didnt know how to stand up to myself for fear of hurting the other person for telling them how i felt i was never taught how to show emotions or how to use them interpret them i know what they look like and how they feel but showing them using them youd have better luck getting a volcano to spew water but this is how i was brought up and its what i knew life for me was like looking through beer goggles for everyone else it was distorted and i had a fake image of what it was because of this i matured faster in other aspects of life i grasped adult concepts earlier than most and grew into them into worrying about what others think of me always comparing myself to everyone else not just the best or the people above me but everyone i felt like everyone hated me and thought i was some annoying kid so i shut myself off from the world thats the first few years of life i ran around as a happy lonely kid as i grew up and was about 10 or 11 i learned to read people and guess what they were feelingthinking how their day was going n shit i learned to feed off of everyones emotions around me rather than feeling my own i essentially shut off my own emotions without realizing it and now im struggling with fixing it i fed off of the kids that were happy and replicated their happiness as my own i imitated them and copied them to feel included i grew up like this trying to fill that big empty lonely hole i felt i buried it deep down and as a green swamp friend of mine once said i became an onion i made layers to try to hide it but nothing seemed to work sorry this post has kinda became a pity party it was not my intention fuck it lets continue the next couple years of my life pretty much continued on like this building my wall of fake emotions to protect everyone else from my greatest enemy myself i didnt trust myself to not fuck up didnt trust myself to really connect with anyone i lied to everyone around me and pushed anyone away that tried to get close or learn who really was on the inside it was repulsive and wrong but i didnt know that i would say this is when i got my first taste of depression around the age of 12 grades 57 i was the class runtguinne pigdoormat i was the kid being bullied the other kids unanimously decided i was the kid they picked on fucking private religious bullshit school did nothing to prevent what they were doing to me nor did they seem to care hell even the teachers  would pick on me so i accepted who i was and that was the school fuck up i tried to take their name tag and wear it with pride yea it worked for a bit as armor i made myself insensitive to the bullying for the first little bit but grade 6 is when the smack down really started to happen and i became the germ these kids had gotten the idea to give me the permanent cheese touch or the germ as they liked to call it this was the tipping point for me all my so called classmates and friends i had suddenly turned on me and i was alone truly alone left half dead for the vultures to pick at i broke i broke into so many little pieces all those people i grew up around people i trusted turned i couldnt touch anyone with out them screaming dont touch me germ great thanks now i have to wash myself and other hurtful shit like that they couldnt even sit in a chair i had used without washing it and sanitizing it okay i say i was alone but i had 2 friends payton and dane they tried to help they tried everything they could but the other kids wouldnt back down half way thru the school year i attempted suicide i had the steak knife pointed at my heart and started pushing i drew a little blood but it hurt to much so i stuck around i had only told dane and he kept it quite for a while like i asked him to but one day he told me that he had to tell the teacher it wasnt something he liked knowing and didnt like how close i was to not being here so he told that i wasnt feeling good in my head that i was going thru some tough times due to the class and what they were doing this teacher had 0 clue that it was happening and immediately went to the principal brought me with her and told me to tell her what was going on i played dumb for so long hoping that it would just end i didnt want to deal with it but they persisted and eventually brought dane in and asked him what was up after he started to say something i broke i told them almost everything about me wanting to die not wanting to live and how i wished everyone else would die first i didnt tell them how i had attempted suicide my worst fears had come true i spoke up and now everyone hated me they couldnt bully me but did they hate me after the whole class got a ripped a new ass hole for pushing a kid to suicidal thoughts yes i told them i had thoughts no i didnt tell them i tried i came back into the class room and im greeted with silence and stone cold eyes staring back at me the first thing this kid told me who i thought was one of the people that i had as an acquaintance you know op fuck you you go and cry to the principal that we dont treat you nicely well guess what you want us to treat you with dignity and respect well how about trying to treat us that way next time think before you speak i cant tell you how much this affected me that kid got sent home for the rest of the week this is supposed to be where that part of the story ends right no those fuckers came back the next and kept calling me the germ kept bullying me and bullied me harder than before grade 7 was a repeat of grade 6 aging more and more i hid more and more of my emotions and just kept feeding off others and relying on them for how to react in different situations elementary school behind me and moving to middle school i made new friends a new chapter in life friendsthat didnt judge one guy even had the same name as me mysteriouslyreddited i started to notice girls at this point too two girls in particular quinn and anna quinn is a couple years younger than i had been babysat by my mother and i by her mother they switched out as they both worked and she well quinns amazing pretty no beautiful shes got these eyes that just her hair wow and her smile   just everything she was my first crush although quickly forgotten we went to different schools you know out of sight out of mind k not like that but i hadnt seen her in a while anna on the other had well i can describe her similarly but things were different with anna they were easier its well she was the girl i fell head over heels for and she knew it we talked for hours upon hours but it was never meant to be i continued on the same way i did in elementary school by wearing armor and growing my onion anna and i stayed close for a couple years me being wrapped around her finger while she went after other guys i got her a couple boyfriends reluctantly i introduced her to a couple guys i knew she was crushing on and i enjoyed watching her be with them as i look back i was feeding off of her boyfriends emotions and mixed them with my own bad idea 010 would recommend and well this went as well as you may guess it went great wrong i was confused and shut off shut down and shot down i dont remember what started a fight between us but it went on for months it became personal for the both of us i told her not to come to my funeral she told me to fuck off and go die words were said damage was done and i thought i was okay with it i learned quickly that i in fact was not okay and my fight with her had broken my armour and i was bare everything was out and we both fell into depression because of what we did to each other i was having more and more suicidal thoughts i had spiraled to my lowest point that ive ever been self harm alchohol skipping school it was the worst part of my life highschool is the hardest for everyone isnt it its not oof my bad i was skipping school fighting with my mothers husband smoking pot and drinking waaaaay to much booze the fall out of not having anna in my life was ruining me yes i felt for her and yes i wanted her back in my life but the hatred for her at the same time was almost outweighing the good i felt for her i cut everyday for over 2 years i didnt know what to do the pain felt good and brought me out of my head and prevented me about thinking about anything as long as the blade was on me my entire depressive episode was brought on because i couldnt stand up for myself or tell myself its okay or when to stop i lost myself lost my armor lost everything or at least i thought i lost everything when in reality i was only just discovering life i became cold and truly shut off my emotions and didnt even feed off others i became a robot i woke up late went to school skipped all my classes went home played cod or skyrim and went to bed rinse repeat and thats how i lived from day to day month to month for a couple years i still havent reconnected with anna anna if you end up reading this im sorry for the bad memories i like to think that we still have some love left for each other but i know thats false as i lived like this my family life started to become stretched and strained being brought up as a christian i was told to believe in god that hes the answer to all and just ask him for help i called bullshit and that if he truly cared that none of us would suffer if we suffer then why the fuck did jesus die on the cross for us my grandparents and mother didnt take kindly to these words and how dare i speak about god in that manor after mass one sunday i would have been like 15 we were at the grandparents and the topic of vacations came up and how i hadnt been on one in years and id like to go when peeps went down to visit cousins from another town a days drive away it was spring break and they were leaving next weekend i inquired if i could go with them and because of my grades i was told no i told them if they let me go id pick up the pace in school and i would try but only if they let me go well my attitude needed to be fixed because the next thing i know my mother is yelling at me and telling me how entitled i am and that id be lucky to consider even going me being the teen i was i yelled back fuck yous were exchanged my grandfather had enough and tried to manhandle me no fucking chance gramps not in my current state we had a fist fight that ended up with him having broken glasses he litterally ripped my shirt off me ripped my necklace off and threw me into a door and him thrown onto the floor he got up and started to yell get the fuck out of here you can come back when your damn well ready to apologize until then get out i replied with well then i guess it wasnt nice knowing you when youre ready to get your grandson back track me down and tell me how sorry you are and left without looking back he did track me down the next day and told me he was sorry about how he reacted and stepping so far out of line that night after we made up and got a blizzard i went home to find my mothers husband fuming because of how i talked to my mother which cause a fight with him that was the night i lost my home my family he had disowned me and cast me out like garbage even tho that was one of my lowest points i didnt see it as a loss yea i was fucked but i was also free to do what i want when i want so i started working on myself i moved to a new city enrolled in a new school and started fresh while i did climb out of my depressing hole i have yet to beat depression i got a great girlfriend and living large now adays  started some anti depressants counseling and what not well now im gonna skip ahead to why i wanted to get some baggage off my back a few weeks ago i went out to the bar with some friends and i ran into none other than quinn id had some pregame drinks had some drinks while i was there i didnt eat anything that day was already dehydrated and alcohol should not be consumed like that while on meds so i was already drunk feeling great id seen quinn once and didnt know what to say so i just smiled and ignored her well let me tell you it was so fucking hard to ignore her i mean if you were me youd find it impossible to so i did what any drunk man does i had a shot and approached her asked if i could buy her a drink and  from what i remember we hit it off i had a blast but tbh i was not looking for anything in her i just remembe how i used to feel but more importantly j remembered all the fun times we use to have growing up and all the memories with her over the years i was no i am lonely and she seemed to just kinda be there so we were talking and i looked at her and time just seemed to stop we talked but i dont remember what it was about at one point i asked if i could kiss her my self conscience was screaming at me telling me this was not okay but the alchohol was in too deep there is so much that i wish i could remember about that night but i cant i dont know what happened what i said or did this is the hardest ive had to fight this depression in a long time and this time im worried that i wont be able to win i dont recognize who i am anymore i dont like this person ive become i love my gf but i feel like im going to drag her down and make her depressed like me i feel like im not good enough for her and im hurting her by being with her i cant stop thinking about quinn but i think i fucked up even trying to be friends with her there was a small spark there but nothing major besides i dont want there to be a spark right now ive talked to my gf and she knows i have feelings for another it was hard to deal with at first but after we talked about it she knows

maybe someone will read it and realize they are not aloneive started writing this so many times and lost motivation half way through this is yet another attempt lets see what happensim a 30 year old woman i work as a photographer for a fashion company with a degree in graphic design volunteer at a cat rescue 2 days a week and suffer from depression and socialgeneral anxiety disorderi first realized my teen angst wasnt just a phase sometime in my early 20s as a teenager i would do the normal things drink do drugs smoke weed i would also write a lot but this writing in hindsight was some of the deepest cries for help ive since lost that precious notebook but i did come upon snippets of that poetry in my other sketchbooks the stuff wasnt anything out of the ordinary  i grew up listening to emo and other such heart wrenching music  and the style was really just lyrics trying to artistically describe the dark cloud that was inside of me every minute of every day i lost interest in that activity around the age of 20i was always a shy person i played with friends during school but i was never allowed to have anyone over or go to anyones house as a result i was always found by myself in the yard skipping rope alone my parents brought me to canada when i was 9 years old in order to expand my options for education i was born in russia where there wasnt much choice at the time to do anything with your life other than engineering medicine or teaching in that aspect i thank them i was able to attend an art school in toronto and attain my graphic design degree which my anxious artistic brain appreciateswhen i arrived in canada i didnt speak much english and was in an esl program in that first year 4th grade i was bullied for not speaking the language some girls quickly realized that it would be fun to put rocks the little pebbles from the playground down my pants while we had carpet time when all the kids gather around crossed legged on the floor in front of the teacher during a lesson they knew i wouldnt say anything partly because i couldnt physically partly because i couldnt mentally kids would kick my chair constantly as they walked by someone even throw things at me from the back i brushed it off went on with it i did have two great friends one of which is still in my life albeit we arent closethis childish bullying subsided after the first year i went off to another school in grade 5 after moving buildings with my parents 6th grade was split it was yet another school moving from elementary to middle school and then half way through 6th grade after establishing quite a solid group of new friends i was transferred to a new school after yet another move by my parents i had to start over with the friend thing and luckily i befriended a girl right away she was also an outcast being extremely tiny and skinny for her age and also didnt fit in with the cool popular kids here i was laughed and looked down upon for being new having 1 friend and being so extremely shy after a while i became close with another girl lets call her jessica 7th grade went by bearably with her around outside minor incidents like having the basketball thrown at my head during recess i was also developing extremely bad acne so i was doomed to be the ugly shy girl for the next few yearsending of 8th grade is where the real trouble started with jessica she had an in with the cooler kids in the grade and being so attached to her i got to hang out with the group occasionally this is where we started relationships with two boys she was with lets call him andrew and i was with lets call him mike we would hang out after school a lot and one day i brought them all over to my house mike took me down to my parents cellar at one point and where i thought i would have my first kiss my hands were forced down onto his penis i didnt know how to retaliate so i went with it instead of a first kiss i gave my first hand job the next time we hung out was at the movies i was brought to the bathroom for what i thought was a make out session but turned out to be an attempt at a blow job i cant remember whether i went through with it i just remember crying that evening i soon found out that andrew and mike had a bet going of who would get their dick sucked first and jessica agreed to bring me into the group so they could use me for that bet these things bled into high school the rumours started that i was a slut and were reinforced with photos being distributed throughout the school the photos were of me wearing see through mesh pants in provocative poses that jessica took of me in her room one night when we were having a fun fashion night she wore them too although somehow the photos of her never got distributed finally a new girl came to the school lets call her beth and finally things seemed to calm down we had a great friendship going and were inseparable during high school to the point where people were calling us lesbians i even attended her wedding two years ago shes a beautiful human being i tried my best to have a normal life i threw myself into art i would come to school at 7 in the morning so spend time in the photography dark room lab i got great marks in my classes and my teachers loved me of course throughout this time i did the regular teenage girl stuff i liked boys i would make out with them i was already well trained in the hand job department so guys learned to hand me over to their friends once they were done with me i just did it it made them happy and in my mind that made me good at it why not do the thing that i felt i excelled at of course none of that behaviour helped the growing rumours i first tried drugs in 10th grade beth and i would skip school pop ecstasy spend the day together this went on for about a year in the 11th grade where my marks drastically plummeted im not sure what the triggering factor for me to stop was but i managed to graduate high school on the honour roll at the end of 12th grade i met lets call him sam we dated for 2 years i lost my virginity to him but i will always remember doubting his intentions did he stay with me for the sex did he only want me around because i would smoke weed with him it didnt matter i lost romantic interest in him after a year but stayed together despite us fighting because it was comfortable and a habit i just didnt want to or couldnt breaki got into my top school of choice and spent the first year working hard after my break up with sam i met lets call him dale it was interesting at first he would show up at my work almost daily and chat and finally we started going on real dates he brought me gifts and showered with me with attention i now realize that it was borderline stalker behaviour he wouldnt take no for an answer even if i didnt really feel like doing anything the thing with dale is kind of an on and off ordeal we were never fully together but would hang out often usually drinking or going on drives i was starting to get really put off by him but one night he insisted on hanging out as you well know by now i have trouble saying no so we went to the bar got a buzz going and then went driving i know how shameful it is to drink and i drive i know first hand because i almost killed my friend during a drunk driving episode i havent done it since and will never do it again we were in the car and i was completely insistent that this was a non sexual meet up but he wouldnt stop trying to kiss me to push my hands on to his crotch then pushing my head down asking me to just suck it a little i did it just to make him shut up so i could go home i havent seem him since them i refused to talk to him and eventually had to block him to this day he tries to make attempts at communication but nothing dangerous the truly destructive behaviour started around 22 when i began to frequent parties at first it was drinking and a lot of it then i met a 28 year old man lets call him izack he was a dj and very much into the rave party scene it was with him when i tried coke for the first time at the age of 23 or 24 lets just call the rest a blur i would party twice a week heavily on drugs go to school completely hung over long story short i just managed to graduate scraping by with a warning letter and passing marks given to me probably only out of the kindness of my professors heart i loved izack he was older had more experience best sex ive ever had and he made me forget everything and everyone he lived downtown in an apartment with two other roommates who also loved to party and we all got along quite well the sanctuary of that apartment was heavenly i would be able to spend all my time there away from my strict russian parents then izack started going on the road a lot more due to his dj career flourishing when he was away i would come to his place and clean everything i bought him a huge new tv for his room i wanted him to come home to a beautiful place in my mind that was me saying thank you for letting me stay with him rent free for so many days of the week about a year into our relationship i went for a gynaecologist check up which was followed by a phone call saying that i have an std they told me to get myself and my partner into the office so we could be given medication it was nothing overly serious cleared up with a few pills but i had to have a serious conversation with izack he swore on his life that he never cheated on me he begged me to believe him which after hours upon hours of me crying and pleading i finally did but i never got over the nagging feeling that something wasnt right so after a month of uncertainty over the phone on my birthday i remember that day so clearly i asked him one more time im not sure what made him tell me truth this time around but yes of course he slept with someone on tour and yes that is how i contracted the stdi was a complete and utter wreck for the next few months the drugs and alcohol increased i went on tinder and began my first sex binge at one point i managed to sleep with 6 different men in one week all i wanted to do was to forget the hurt and i didnt know how again all of this is very blurry so i cant say the exact moment that izack came back into my life but he did i remember going to a bar to meet him to get closure to finally say i forgive him and that im moving on that meeting ended up with me in his apartment and sex we then got back together continued the destructive behaviour until his next tour where he slept with someone again i let that one go easily since we never stated that we were officially a couple again i think this is where i learned how to numb my brain from hurt i wasnt mad at him anymore i just quietly walked away and threw myself into my second huge sex binge on tinder after a few months of this i met a guy lets call him jon we dated for something close to a year this relationship was also fuelled by alcohol drugs and parties but at this point i didnt want another life the relationship involved me crying almost every day at work with something abusive he may have said to me that day for example he loved to make me feel like an idiot for asking him why it took him hours to answer a text massage i was told i was crazy on an almost daily basis i will fast forward to the end where a girl who is now a friend reached out to me saying that she was also dating jon for 6 months now she spotted us at a party kissing and lost her mind apparently she had no knowledge of me for the long while they were together it turns out that we werent the only ones i came to the knowledge that he had slept with 8 different people during the span of being with me this included his upstairs neighbour who i was constantly told not to worry about i laughed at this i didnt cry i didnt feel angry i laughed pulled out my phone and on to the next tinder binge i wentit took me about 6 months to get into my next relationship this one was with a kind man who would never do a thing to hurt me it lasted for about 2 years i met his parents and he met mine we were talking about marriage and moving in together but it ended up falling apart during our search for an apartment we just werent right for each otherso this is where i am now 30 years old living back with my parents i have since stopped the partying because that life doesnt satisfy me anymore and my body cant handle it i have been coke free for about a year now mainly because i cant afford it but i drink i drink several times a week because i cant stand my job i drink because i feel trapped in my own mind i drink because of my living situation i drink because nothing i do excites me i drink about 3 times a week and once i crack a bottle of wine there is no way i can stop that bottle is getting drunk to the last drop and more often than not a second one gets opened and lasts about half way until i pass out the job thing  realized im the only one who can help myself there so i have been taking lots of photos and editing them in an effort to update my portfolio but sitting down and editing those photos sober just isnt an option i go to work i laugh with my coworkers but at the end of the day the only thing that makes me happy and that i took forward to is that next drink i started exercising and have been continuing to do so pretty consistently but i always fall off the boat because i cant stay excited and motivated last night i came home to my collection of wine bottles all out and displayed in front of me by my dad my mom discovered the first bottle in my closet when she couldnt find my cat or so she says she then proceeded to go through every crevice of my room and pulled out the 20 or so i had hidden long story short my life of drinking after work and during my own photo editing hours is over and i am terrified i feel like i have nothing happy to come home to i spent all last night crying and today is the first day i didnt show up to work because of this the thing is  i dont know if i want to stop ive had thoughts of suicide since my early teenage years and they have never gone away ive cut myself on numerous occasions i have dabbled with the idea of overdosing on my anxiety and depression medication i did go into therapy for a few months but that turned out way too pricey for my minimal salary my dad has offered to pay for my therapy last night but this is an offer im not sure i want to take i just want it to be over the only times things are okay in my brain is when i am sleeping or when i am heavily buzzed i dont have children nor a boyfriend and i have maybe 2 friends so im finding it difficult to see a purpose to go on i would like to finish by saying how awful i feel about putting this out there the amount of times the word i is used is upsetting and selfish since i know there are people out there who have it way worse than me like my parents have pointed out numerous times i have nothing to be sad about i have a good job a warm house food and water i have a car that my dad so kindly gave to me when he bought himself a new one and they are right i have it so good but inside that dark cloud just wont lift and there is no way i can describe it in words to someone who hasnt felt the pull of itthank you from the bottom of my heart to anyone who read this fully attempted to read it or even glanced at it i am very scared and for some reason the only thing i thought of this morning was writing this,0,depression

1079,A story to hopefully bring you back from the brink of suicide...,hi there i dont know if this will help you at all but if it helps even one person thats enough for me a bit of back ground information i am a 22 year old that has been suffering from severe depression for the past year with suicidal thoughts everyday of every hour i felt like i was already dead cause no one seemed to notice me and i was slowly wasting away from the inside out i also began to hear voices that would constantly berate me and tell me to kill myself and after this i sought help from my gp and was put onto antidepressants sertraline which did absolutely nothing they didnt make it worse but they certainly didnt make it betteri was then put onto another antidepressant mirtazapine which i started taking at the beginning of february 2020 which seemed to help i had the energy to finally get out of bed take a shower and leave the house but a couple of weeks ago i noticed that although i had the energy to get up and go about my daily life i was still thinking about killing myself everyday but this time it was different as i had the energy and motivation to actually come up with a detailed plan and go through with it and this scared me so much as i have never felt an urge to kill myself as much as i have in the last couple of weeks so yesterday i had a lot to deal with my partner has been very sick with an unknown illness for nearly a year so his parents rushed him to hospital i was an absolute mess as i have been really struggling to silence the suicidal thoughts whilst also fulfilling my duty as a carer for my partner i had a mental breakdown after they took him to the hospital as the voices wouldnt stop i actually began shouting back at them but after a few minutes sobbing on the bathroom floor i became completely numb and decided to follow through with my plan i grabbed my supplies which involved a dog lead but i had made sure to buy this one especially for this occasion as it perfectly fit around my neck and had a sturdy metal clip which i could attach to the banister which would hold my weight i was ready to do it i was ready to go and i put the collar around my neck and began to push my neck down into the collar to cut off the blood supply to the main artery in my neck i heard this would only take a minute or so to make me unconscious and the whole time i was holding my dog close to my chest cause i was so scared but i wanted to die so badly as i could feel myself going i stopped and i dont know what stopped me but part of me thought that it wasnt my time to go so i ended up picking up the phone and calling someone who managed to calm me down and helped me look at everything from a different perspective i know a lot of people will say that its selfish for feeling suicidal or committing suicide due to the hurt it would cause to familyfriends etc but from what i felt yesterday none of that mattered i truly believed that i wanted to die and if i hadnt have stopped myself when i had i would probably be dead now but this morning my partner finally got an official diagnosis of what has been making him so ill i am currently sat in the hospital waiting for him to come out of surgery and i have been told by the doctors that he is going to live a very healthy normal life after this operation if i had have killed myself yesterday afternoon i would never have gotten to find out that my partner was going to be okay i would never get to marry him in april i would never get to see him healthy and happy again all of these things i would have never known if i was dead now i can now look forward to being able to spend time with my partner who can now start to enjoy his life again and i can try and enjoy mine as much as i can knowing that he will be around for a long time what im trying to get at after my long ass story is that if there is any sort of hope you can cling onto whether thats a friend a pet something youve got planned in the near future or even just the feeling of the sun on your skin anything to get you through each day you never have know when your life could take a turn for the best or if something amazing will happen and all of these things you will never get to experience if you end it all now im not here to say that you shouldnt do it because at the end of the day im just some stranger on the internet that you dont know but what i do know is that things can always get better always but you never know when and youll never know if youre not here,1,suicidal

1099,I have nowhere and no one else to say this,this is going to be a long post because i have a lot to say sorry in advance i dont see any way my life can get on track im 23 years old i have achieved nothing noteworthy in life and ive generally lived a life of isolation this stems all the way back from secondary school where i was relentlessly bullied for being black and overweight i was only 11 years old when i first got diagnosed with depression because of the sheltered life i had lived before then meant i had no idea what people would be like once i got to high school no one told me that being black was something that people may not like no one told me that being overweight would be something kids would make fun of but it happened for 4 years straight throughout high school i ran into various obstacles id never want a kid to go through almost weekly fights bad report cards and parents evenings lead to detentions and 3 day exclusions which lead to me starting to simply skip school and not go i tried so hard to get myself kicked out of that school because my mother would not take me out of the school i didnt understand why then and i still dont understand now and i think part of me resents her for that to this day i truly believe my life could have been so different if i didnt get forced to stay at the school that almost killed me multiple times the bullying definitely subsided a touch in the last year with kids wanting to get into good 6th forms they started looking to just finishing their exams i guess but the damage was already done i started school a pretty normal happy kid with a fair few friends who didnt think about much besides what pokemon i needed to catch to fill my national dex or if i the cartoon i wanted to watch was recorded but by my last year i was could barely be bothered to do anything i didnt talk to anyone i simply went to school and got the bus home and avoided people at all costs i had skipped way too much school to get good grades and i could motivate myself to want to study i was getting the bare minimum to get into 6th form and hopefully that was enough to scrape by but as if things wernt bad enough i went on a residential school trip with one of my classes that was cut short because i ended up having a severe athsma attack when we got the the accommodation camp this was my first time having an athsma attack and my first time id have ever been to hospital and i was only 15 so my first feelings were obviously of extreme panic a small part of me id say was honestly relieved maybe this was the end and i wouldnt have to go on the ambulance got there and i must have asked the responded a hundred times if i was going to die obviously she cant tell a child probably so she said no and was comforting me the ride to the hospital felt like an eternity to wrap this part up obviously i didnt die but i had woken up a week later in the icu surrounded by my family it was weird seeing my dad and mum together as well as their partners because they had been split up for a long time but i was just happy i woke up i guess i had to stay in hospital for a few days more after i woke up for tests and rehab getting used to walking again after being in bed for a week was interesting and a lot harder than i ever thought it would be i was told that people who suffer acute asthma attacks generally have a low survival rate i cant remember the exact number but it was low enough to cause a reaction from everyone we left the hospital and i was told i wouldnt be able to go back to school for at least a month obviously any kid would be thrilled to hear that but i was super happy because it meant time away from hell on earth however the recovery process during that month kind of set the precedent for a hole i got trapped in and am still trapped in doing nothing for a month meant i got into some pretty lazy habits but also i got used to being on my own world just playing xbox and watching tv during the day transitioning back into school life was harder than anticipated because it was half days to start off with and that was for about 2 weeks fast forward a bit and the bullying starts again because fuck it why not bully the kid fresh out of hospital right it gets to exam period and i have full on sacked off school i skip most days and get put into the assisted education program where you take exams in a different room and have a personal ta and some counselling sessions of course none of this really helped me because i just didnt have any care for my education i just wanted away from school asap i by some miracle without studying at all managed to scrape by with enough gcse qualifications to go to 6th form on the condition that i would have to take english and maths alongside a foundation year this leads onto my next problemfor more reasons unknown to me which i can only chalk up to she cant be bothered my mum decided for me that i wasnt going to go to a college in my hometown i would have to instead go to live with my dad and do my 3 years of college there now i should probably explain why this is a problem my dad and i dont get on well we havent for as long as i stopped being a child and we still have barely any real relationship i just talk to him like once a month to talk to my little brother and sister who obviously i have no reason to not have a relationship with i wont go into as much detail here because this post is already feeling too long but theres so much more to get through long story short my dad was extremely emotionally abusive anything that he didnt like would be met with screaming banging on things and threats of physical violence this would be for anything from not doing the dishes to not studying earlier than what was on my plan this again warped my view of education because i wasnt really doing courses i enjoyed but rather what was available to me and i didnt feel inspired to commit to it by studying most of my study time was just sneaking my phone on silent this went on for 3 years straight i was isolated the only person i really interacted with was my abusive dad and my teachers and classmates when i had to when i tried to confide in my mother she simply told me other people including herself had it worse and hes just strict and does it because he cares about me and wants whats best so i gave up on that as well throughout my life one of the few things i really enjoyed was playing video games and i used it as an escape to just ignore my real life situation and responsibilities how healthy that is is up for debate but if i didnt have that escape who knows if id even be typing this here now he didnt like that i played video games because he said that it was pointless and took away time i could be studying or looking for work so he took it away and never let me have it back on any occasion after half of the first year thats when things got really bad for me without something to pass the time and take my mind off of things my depression and suicidal tendencies came flooding back i started self harming and i still look at the scars along my arms sometimes and get reminded of how bad things were back then i never thought that they would still be there 6 years later i wish i had thought about that somehow 3 years later again without really putting in any effort i managed to complete my a levels and get enough points to get into university on a foundation entry degree i guess this was when i was happiest because i was finally free from my parents and maybe i could be someone new and different i never would have imagined myself where i am now 4 years agouni life started off fine i was still avoiding people and keeping to myself but a couple of people on my course would always sit next to me and try to talk to me i guess because seeing someone sitting on their own in their first year of uni made them want to include me so i even managed to have friends the first year had some hardships because i was never taught how to budget or be independent so of course money got tight towards the end but aside from that i dont think my first year had any issues i passed without any issues and found myself advancing to the first year of the actual degree i wont go into detail for every year but ill just say that apart from the odd times wed go out together i still mostly stayed in my flat playing games or watching stuff online i didnt party and i didnt study i just kind of drifted then for whatever reason i cannot remember i got into an argument with my mum i cant remember what about but she sent me a message saying that she was done with me and i didnt really know what to feel i just kind of stopped i stopped going to uni i stopped going out i stopped everything i just started spending every day waking up playing games and eating junk food sleep repeat as you can imagine having a lifestyle like this really did a number on my mental and physical health i would go an entire week without showering sometimes more my only human contact was taking my food from downstairs this was my lowest point obviously i failed the year because i didnt attend or do all the work the next year i was allowed to stay at the uni and take up a different course thinking that i could just power through it but apparently during all of this student finance the company that pays your tuition fees turned around and said they wouldnt fund this year of learning for me which obviously kind of fucked me over completely because they told me i wouldnt be funded i decided that there was no point in going because i certainly dont have 9k just laying around to pay the fees myself i didnt attend a single lecture all year and lived the same unhealthy life i had lived towards the end of the previous year for the entire year it was horrible the one beacon of hope that i could find was that eventually i had to start benefits as i didnt get money to pay the rent or anything so that covered that meanwhile there was a local game store that ran a tournament for the game a play and i really enjoyed going to that once a week and made friends with the team i was assigned to my life finally felt like it had some form of normality i had a decent friend group i was finally going out and i had something to look forward to whilst i tried to find proper work to fill my time and move into my own place but unfortunately i couldnt find work and it came time to decide what i was going to do next in the summer at this time i had another argument with my mum because she began to catch on that clearly something was wrong and i didnt want to go to university and do a degree i had no interest inwe hadnt spoken in almost a month and i was sure we had cut ties but then she messaged me pleading me to come to an open day for a course that did in all honestly sound extremely appealing to me so i went and the place seemed nice and this where i am now i got onto the course and im currently here now in the same situation but worse that i was in for the 3rd year at the previous uni i havent attended almost any of the classes im almost certainly going to be kicked out or have to retake the year but thats not even the worst part the worst part is that im still being asked to pay for other years that i was told would be funded including this year meaning im in an insane amount of debt with no way to pay it off this year also isnt being funded despite being told it would be and im currently in negative balance in my bank account with the next payment of my underfunded maintenance loan coming in on the 20th of next month i havent eaten in 3 days already and i dont feel all that good my parents arent an option and i have tried to ask for help in the loansassistance reddits but i got marked as a scammer because i wasnt getting any replies but kept trying i dont know what to do i think i am well and truly ready for the end i dont see how i can recover from this hole i put myself into im 23 years old with no degree debt no work experience meaning i cant get any jobs despite the 100s of applications ive probably sent off by now ive never had a romantic partner hell ive never even had a real best friend im completely alone and i dont think anyone will miss me when im goneim sorry this was such a long read but i dont have anyone else to talk to and really explain things to so this is my last resort i dont think i want to die but i really dont see how i can live on,0,depression

1110,[TW] I am 16 and have attempted suicide 4 times; bullying about my appearance is making me consider it again,i generally steer clear of making posts of this nature since i dont like discussing my personal life on social media that said this is something that i feel i must be open about in order to come to terms with it to contextualise im a 16 year old girl and im originally from eastern europe but i now live in the uk this may be a very long read and ill be sure to tldri was diagnosed with autism at the age of 4 im not low functioning for lack of a better term feel free to suggest one per se but to other people its pretty obvious that i am developmentally disabled i have poor fine motor skills struggle to articulate my thoughts and am extremely susceptible to meltdowns when not on birth control ill explain this laterfor most of my early childhood this was largely not a huge issue in my life i received good support and people were usually empathetic towards my struggles however things started to go slowly and then eventually very dramatically downhill once i got my period age 10my parents noticed that i had menstrual cycles that were on average around 21 days in length initially they werent too worried and assumed they would eventually become more regular as time went on they didnt they became shorter and when i last calculated them my cycles lasted 18 days on average this messed up my hormones and i became extremely depressed this depression peaked around my period i dont mean that i got typical premenstrual symptoms in the days leading up to my period i would self harm have suicidal thoughts experience very violent and dramatic mood swings become extremely sensitive to sound and texture and lose interest in my hobbies and friends i suggested possibly having pmdd but this idea was dismissed by my parents and doctorsi first attempted suicide when i was either 13 or 14 but definitely no older i didnt inform my parents of this but only because i didnt want to upset them or make them feel like they had failed me as parents because they definitely didnt i then attempted once more aged 15during this time period i was prescribed the combined oral contraceptive pill theoretically i am supposed to tricycle them or in other words take three months worth of packs and then take a break i did this until the second most recent attempt in october of last year this was the first one that i told anybody about and you may not be shocked to hear that it happened whilst i was on a period break i went to aampe the next day where i waited for seven hours before being seen by a therapist for twenty minutes who told me that i seemed to have things under control and took no action except refer me to another therapist who i had one appointment with where i heard the same thing it was my mothers birthday that day and i have not forgiven myself for making her spend it in aampe she stayed mostly collected throughout it all but i could tell she felt very upset and shaken since this i have stopped taking breaks and now do not have periods at all this is massively helpful but my situation is still not greatits partly for that reason that i didnt inform her of my most recent attempt in december it was also because i was due to fly to canada the day after the attempt and couldnt bring myself to jeopardise the trip i considered calling a suicide hotline once i was in montreal but ended up not doing it mainly because when i looked up numbers to call i couldnt find one in quebec that offered english counselling but also because my mother discouraged it because of what we would be charged please remember she didnt know that i had attempted suicideim in year 11 which in the uk is the final year of high school im currently caught up in revising for my gcses which im doing ok with from an academic perspective but struggling to cope with mentally im also being bullied less than in previous years but still in a way that fucks me up even though i pretend it doesnt i used to be targeted for my personality and mannerisms which ive given up being upset about since ive accepted that i dont carry myself typically recently though theyve shifted to targeting my appearancethis may make me sound shallow but as a 16 year old girl having my appearance mocked and scorned is completely crushing a few months ago it was never something i gave much thought and i never felt insecure about my appearance outside of typical concerns teenage girls have people call me ugly and laugh at me to my face ive never been in a relationship of any kind and at the risk of sounding like an incel this does not give me hope for the future and makes me question if i am physically attractive to anybody it makes me feel arrogant for having ever thought that there was nothing wrong with the way i look and im starting to spiral emotionally because of it 15 year old me would have laughed at the idea of me being so insecure about my physical appearance but for me it was one of the few things i had genuine confidence and pride in and now it is being taken from mei feel very shallow and fragile for feeling this way im 16 and have four attempts to my name and its embarrassing i hate that ill never really be able to disassociate myself from that because this isnt what i want to look back on in 10 or 20 years timetldr im a 16 year old autistic girl who has attempted suicide 4 times and is now reconsidering due to bullying concerning my physical appearance,1,suicidal

1122,Asshole dad doesn't support my dreams. Long rant.,im 24 years old and have recently graduated from college with a ba in art art has been my passion since i was a little kid and i hope i can one day have an exhibition showcasing my art so back in 2019 just a few months after graduating college i applied for this artists residence program i knew that i probably wouldnt get accepted as these residences are usually very popular and i was still buliding up mycareer in art but i still wanted to try and get more experienced in writing applications and though id give it a go and you never know i might just be lucky enough to be accepted this particular application had to be sent in by post so i asked my mum for a stamp later that day my dad sees the stamp booklet and asks what it was doing there so my mum told him he just conpleatly lost his shit and started yelling at my mum he was arngry that my mum hadnt told him about my plans to apply for this residence i could hear the yelling from my bedroom and came down to see what it was about i cant remember everything that happened and what was said but basically my dad felt that this was a terrible idea that the residence wouldnt be good for me and that i shouldnt be moving out i kept trying to explain how there were many benefits of doing this residence and how i wouldnt be moving away forever besides i was 23 at the time a lot of people my age had lived away from their parents he however couldnt get his head around it he thought the residence program wasnt legitimate despite the fact that i  found out about it through my college lectures and how they literally give us seminars on how to apply to these residences he keep yelling and screaming causing my mum to cry and sleep in my sisters room that night i didnt let the events of that night keep me from pursuing my dream fast forward to a few days ago and im working on another application for a artist residence this one also has to be sent in by post so this time i tell my dad what im doing just before he went to bed he rolled his eyes but didnt say much the next day im printing off my application and i can hear my dad speaking negativity about this residences to my mummy mum is so kind and loving and supportive of me and my dreams i really couldnt ask more of her anyway i come into the room and tell my dad that i can hear him talking about me he says similar stuff to what he said back in 2019 how hes thinks its a bad idea how he thinks i shouldnt be moving out he is of the belief that im looking at this with rose tinted glasses i try to explain how im not some stupid little kid just following some whimsical dream this is my passion its the thing i have a degree in and very much plan on pursuing  for some reason he cannot understand what a residence involves i thought the team residence made it fairly obvious however i try to explain how its a place you live and work in so you can produce artwork in a proper studio hes still just shaking his head saying its a bad idea i ask him why he thinks its a bad idea but he just cuts me off and tells me to tell him why its a good ideaonce again i try to explain the benefits because im just making small bits of watercolour paintings in my bedroom and having a studio would be so much more idealhe stars asking questions about how they chose people i explain about how you send in a cover letter an artist cv and images of your workfor some reason he keeps referring to the residence as a course my mum and i tell his how its not a course its a place to live and work he doesnt seem to understand he says how the only people who will benefit from this course are the people running in he seems to believe that because i wouldnt be paid to attend this residence that its a waste of time im not even asking my parents for money to fund this residence i planned to pay the rent myself the he says how i should be looking for work hes a bit of a booomer he seems to think that theres loads of jobs going round and i just couldnt be bothered to get one not true i had a job not too long ago but it was temporary contract work which ended a few weeks ago he has the nerve to say that when he himself has been unemployed since the early 2000s and my mum is the main breadwinner he just happens to be related to wealthy parents whom he inherited loads of money from when they died he doesnt know the struggle of looking for work or having a strict budget i asked if hed prefer if i were in some dead end job that made me miserable no he says hed like to see me in a job that makes me happy and he sort of suggests to continue with art on the side but apparently working and doing an art residence is just too much anyway getting back on track he mentioned how he thinks im too vulnerable and not ready to move out i dont know how hes going to react when i have enough money saved up to move out but he cant stop me from moving out and living my own life i havent even been accepted by the residence program and hes acting as if im leaving to live on the other side of the worldeverything up to this point has been very upsetting and stressful and depressing but than he goes and says that im not good enough or talented enough thst these no future in this residences no future in art that fucking hurt but i highly suspected this i told him that i already knew that this man hasnt even seen half of my art hasnt see what im capable of doing and doesnt understand how the art world works if i were bad i wouldnt have gotten my ba its still so hard to not let his words get to me im still planning on applying for open calls to residences and exhibitions i know i have talent and i work hard even if im not currently good enough that doesnt mean i should stop the only thing that will stop me from having a future in art is if i give up so i wont give up until i have made it,0,depression

1215,Identity and being suicidal,my problem started about 4 years ago  generally i am a calm person  an introvert more ambivalent i liked being with myself i liked to help i was quite specific very empathetic although i stayed with other normal cool people  i couldnt be a dick over time i noticed that i stand out  others went somewhere spent time etc problems started in high school when it came to partying crazy outings  everyone snapped told their exits as if it was unknown  and i didnt have anyone but one friend  i found that something was wrong with me and i began to change  i wanted to reprogram upload other more extroverted software  at that time i had a completely distorted picture of reality  and for example  i have always been balanced and did not make quick illconsidered decisions  seeing that others dont do it i suppressed it and added it to my new software  seeing that others do not respond immediately to the huts also so began to do  these small seemingly low risk examples have changed me  there were plenty of them  i did so with everything  i know its sick but it was so  i began to think what other peoples lives were like  i wanted to experience these beautiful moments that i heard and told them myself  it lasted a long time  my current personality was changed  i copied every behavior and thinking patterns of the better ones i took an example of after half a year i got depressed i felt terrible memory loss pits i realized what i had done and wanted to unprogram i began to think i analyzed my personality a lot   what should change how to behave and feel i tried to remember my previous identity i had so many copied habits that i didnt know how to behave feel think i didnt feel like myself as if unreal in a dream without contact  with feelings emotions the situation continues to this day  i do not know who i am  i dont feel anything i dont feel myself the only thing keeping me alive is the awareness that it used to be good and its all in my head  i often have thoughts of suicide i have sick thoughts  i classify people according to their qualities that are useful and not i divide people into better and worse  i do not feel anything not once during these 4 years did i feel alive  no sadness no shot of joy no intense feeling he constantly compares himself to others  i do not know how to be myself  i look at others i wonder what they feel how they think what chances i would face against them  the psychologist and therapy did nothing  now he keeps in touch with a psychologist who tells me to stop thinking and follow my feelings i try to do it but i still want to write it  i feel lost  the only thing keeping me alive is reason  nothing else  he tells me he thinks it all  i dont remember what its like to be happy  i do not know who i am thank you for reading and advice,0,depression

friends because i am not really close to them who keeps avoiding me she started to avoid me around the start of the school year she started show her dislike around me when my friends were talking jokingly i cant recall properly sorry that if they were not going to receive any flowers in valentines day hence saying some people in my friend group do they would group up and watch a movie together i was curious so i asked something related to it sorry cant remember exactly  i think i said something like oh what movie or when like when would this event take place  she then rudely replies with who are you this other girl from my friend group just stared at me not in a rude way but in a way i cant read her expression i was kind of hurt thenthis behaviour kept continuing around a few days later i went to the spot where my friends sat and sat next to the girl who apparently dislikes me she immediately stood up and rushed no kidding she ran away from me to the opposite side and sat there i just blankly stared at her again hurt the frick for me the group stayed silent then same girl who looked at me then said oh i know whybecause of this i was in a shit mood the shittiest mood ive been compared to the whole day i was walking to my hsie class where 2 of my other friends were in i asked one of them for her privacy ill call her sally why lets call her fiona keeps avoiding me sally replies saying i said something to fiona a few months ago that pissed her off sally then tells me to not worry and that fiona is a petty person  honestly i thought okay wtf i actually was actually tearing up a bit due to sadness not to the extent of crying thoughtimeskip to a few days with fiona going to the opposite side of the friend circle as always1 and with me now i try no to be near her but even being the slight nearest she goes even further away i asked someone who was friendsclose to fiona while going out of my commerce class to the next period i explained the situation to her whilst clinging to the edge of the wall like that yandere girl from yandere simulator because i am awkward af seriously she also responds to something similar she said fiano used to act up like that to her and i just need to get used to it i was tearing up again not to the extend to cry le fucking sigh she then adds oh you dont like it she then says something similar that sally said before she is just petty ugh so tired of hearing that word from everyonetimeskipshe keeps avoiding me not sitting next to me recently i was going to the bathroom with another girl whilst walking back to class fiona responds hey name and ignores me wow how nice when i talk she glares at me and more more more negative reactions to metoday i had hsie class after lunch i was complaining not in an annoying way about how boring it was and then fucking piano responds with maybe if you had friendsi pause literally a flash of emotions hit me hurtfulness pain frustration anger you name it i had just enough with her play and said something around maybe i should of responded differently more direct and not nicely why do you hate me whatever you did just tell me i will say sorry and blah blah blah sorry i only started to notice i was too kind this year and that it lead to me being hurt and people taking the advantage to go on top of me yeah there are a few girls again why would you hate me who dislike me i

time i had fun during recess or lunchnote 4 out of 5 days i have school meetings on lunch just src things now people just eat due to boredom and half of them go on their phones no little interactions created i am quiet but not the most quiet in the group now i am when they talk they laugh i dontbut seriously i never felt close to my friends they would go to parties parks movies with each other where am i at home they had photos posted on instagram one time of them in a party they tagged each other not including me only one thanks btw not close to her though they printed photo cards of those pictures and shared them to each other as memory some are on their phone case one picture was the korean hand heart that saranghaeyo thingy they made together as a circle wow like that didntt hurtim

1232,Depression and the people who treat it,i have to get this off my chest or im going to go off on someone so as you can read back through my posts i was doing spravato for a very short time before my insurance pulled the rug out from me two weeks into it thats right  two weeks insurance comes back after preapproving my treatment and says since i had not shown a 50 improvement they were denying any further treatments thanks for the warning fuckers so of course my depression and anxiety dropped severely after this happened partly because of being pissed and irate and outright shocked about how they could even do this and second my body and mind didnt care for how i just suddenly stopped treatments so ive been on a downward spiral for about two weeks now well the clinic where i was having the treatments has not really got back to me and kind of dropped me like a bad habit now that they arent getting money from my insurance when the lady called to tell me she said she would talk to the dr in charge of the program and ask him what he wanted to do that was almost two weeks ago ive spoke to her once since and tried calling several times with no call back like seriously  what the fuck you have someone who was telling you i was severely depressed and suicidal enough to get approved for disability  which is not easy to do and youre just gonna fucking ignore my calls and my concerns and let me go to the wayside what happened to checking with the dr to ask him about a next step is that it is it just like  well no more spravato for you so we are done dealing with you im fed the fuck up quite honestly and after waiting all week since talking to her monday im going to call tomorrow and im asking to speak to a supervisor or someone in charge of that fucking place let me just add also that when i first contacted them to set up my initial appointment it took almost two months before i got in there thats right two months it was the beginning of december when i first called and someone was supposed to call me back and i waited and waited and finally called and went off asking them do i have to say im suicidal before someone will take me seriously and call me back it was soon after i finally got in there but to me thats a little ridiculous to think of making a suicidal person wait almost two months to start treatment or be evaluated between that and the insurance screwing me im truly and utterly fed up it makes me sick and pissed off how the system fails people like me and then they wonder why mental illness is such an issue and has such a stigma around it well no fucking wonder if others are treated anything like i have been and i have a feeling that many are then i can see why people lose their shit and either end up killing them selves or others let me clarify  im not in any way condoning that behavior or saying its okay im simply saying that its no wonder theres such an issue with mental illness in this county all that being said where does one go from here ive tried therapists countless medicines obviously the spravato  all to come to this to pretty much be treated as if my life means nothing and completely and utterly ignored i hate to sound narcissistic but god damn my life should be just as important as anyone elses heres the conclusion ive pretty much come to in the last 24 hours i have to stop depending on anyone to help me deal with this fucking sickness i have to depend on myself to somehow get better i am the only one who is here for me nobody else gives a fuck nobody why should they they have nothing invested in me and i mean nothing if they arent getting money from insurance then why bother even returning my phone call right i dont know if this is what our society has come to i seriously want no part of it anymore its disgusting and i am to the point where i hate people in general i know that sounds bad but go back up and reread my post if you really want to try to understand why i am starting to hate people i wasnt always this way yes ive dealt with mental illness most my life in some capacity or another but here in the last 5 years it has hit the absolute bottom of the bottom i look back at times when i thought i was depressed before and i think to myself  id give anything to go back to that time and redo things i dont really have anything else to say ive rambled on enough i just had to get this all out in some way if you made it to this and have read my whole post then thank you youve shown more concern than the people who claimed to be there for me and deal with my depression  until the insurance money stopped coming,0,depression

help me with the chores unless i ask a bunch of times even though i made a chore chart for us both to look aton the fridge and gave myself more things he keeps promising hell do choresshowerbrush his teeth just basic things and he doesnt he actually said hed do all the chores when i went back to schoollike id done for him and not to worry i worried but i left things for a bit and realized i was correct in being concerned after the house started looking trashed if i talk to him he changes the topic or recites some meme he kisses me maybe twice a day and is otherwise glued to his phone watching youtube videos he quit video games as they were time consuming but just switched to videos instead hes so addicted to his phone that he got his by a bus last year while i was passenger hes

things personally but sometimes i cant help it and i feel terrible and other times he is just too close and i feel awkward i think he seems genuinely friendly and most of the time i dont mind him but i guess im just under so much stress at this point that everything is getting to me the whole class is also pretty distracting which again is usually bearable but the stress is wearing me out and

a mental note to make sure to speak up during critique last night and then i panicked first i panicked because i wanted to be done my painting beforehand i hadnt planned properly and am always the slow one in everything so i kept messing up and didnt finish in time it seemed i was one of 2 others who hadnt finished so that made me feel a little better critique came and the aforementioned kid stood next to me as he always does uncomfortably close and then in front of me and i couldnt see the paintings panic increased and i didnt want to be rude so i didnt say anything i planned for what shouldve been my painting for critique and was called out of order and further panicked ampnbspi have a disorder that causes dissociation under stress and i have social anxiety so when i panic my mind goes blank this happened a few days ago my dog is unfortunately aggressive with 1 dog in my neighborhood she is a strong dog and fortunately until this point it had only been my bf who had experienced this she lunged at the dog and i wasnt strong enough to pull her back i panickedmind went blank and i just stood there in my mind the only thing i could think was like the idea or feeling of alarm but i couldnt speak or move the neighbor didnt seem to mind and gave the dogs treats but i felt so terrible i dont know how to fix thisampnbspduring the critique my mind was blank and i didnt know what to say i absorbed things others had said but my mind flushed them out when i tried to speak speaking and thinking at the same time is difficult for me i guess im just stupid i usually think for a long

my older brother harshly picked on me my mom did the most damage somehow i grew up thinking she was good cop she taught me to think that she could do no wrong she was perfect she was always right if she was upset with me even if seemingly unreasonable i did mental gymnastics with myself to justify it example i didnt intervene in her argument with my dad over finances which 6 year old me didnt understand im a bad person who doesnt love mom moms in the bathroom the 8th time this week with razor blades id be her psychiatrist and beg her to come outreason with her why she should eventually i realized i didnt have to say anything eventually still i realized that i could probably leave because she would just come out soon anyway i did once around 6 or 7 and i guess she talked and i didnt respond so she came literally running after me cornered me and yelled down at me for not loving herampnbspi have an eating disorder im evil im a dirty slut even though im not allowed out of the house this must be because of how i look or something ive done am i that person mom says so so i guess so ampnbspas a young child i was mostly raised by my grandparents nextdoor and would sleep over at their house often id cry myself to sleep every night because i thought my mom was mad at me every day id be to blame for something once i even got blamed for my dad losing 100 i dont even know why my mom yelled from up at our back door to down at the yard at me with the neighborhood kids all outside telling me id better bring the 100 back right now so then my friends assumed i was a thiefcause a 9

destroyed my education as an ongoing argument for the funsies i guess i planned to graduate at 15 or 16 and gtfo i was physically bullied at school to the point of having my arms near broken every day

to grade 5 work in everything but math which i got up to maybe grade 3 which was equivalent to my current grade in public school work my parents would argue about public and homeschooling and switch me back and forth at least once a school semester so id be in public school in august for a few months then homeschooled obviously this ruined my extra work id done and i became discouraged in 7th grade i began having a lot of trouble with math my mom refused to help me saying i had learning disability and just couldnt learn so to not do itand then help my lovely psychotic step sister instead shed do this to me at public school too and id often go in humiliated having to explain that i couldnt finish my homework ampnbspat one point i wasnt allowed outsidemy grandparents had moved in and due to that and all the stress i embraced being reclusive i told myself i wanted to be that way and whenever people would think it was odd my mom would huff back at them before i could speak saying that not everyone has to have friendsampnbspand now im this looking back i remember my dad telling me that my mom coddled me too much and kept me from other people wanting me all to herself at the time i thought it was ridiculous but now i see he was right she needed me to soothe her to blame for everything to be there in misery with her ampnbspi got older decided that i wanted to try being social so id say yes to every single opportunity every one that was a terrible idea and i ended up being abused by a few predatory opportunists which in turn caused me major anxiety more than ever before and i became more reclusive than ever before i havent held a stable job in a while havent had friends since that time about 10 years ago ive been with my so who has been abusive off and on things were great for a few years until we moved out a few years ago and now theyve been very off and on for a few years again things have been pretty good as far as that goes but obviously not having time and not feeling effort from the other person feels shitty too ampnbspa couple years ago i found myself in a terrible situation with him and decided my options were prostitution stripping drugs or suicide i mass applied to jobs but when id receive a response i was never qualified for anything but retail which ive had bad experiences with and it doesnt pay enough i stopped eating became an alcoholic with the little funds i had and attempted suicide somewhere near 3 times a week on average for a few months straight i almost succeeded once and then my bf unexpectedly came home early and i was sent to the hospital things didnt get better when i got out i threw away my antidepressants since my feelings felt inappropriate in relation to my thoughts and situation and resumed weekly attempts otherwise id just lie in bed and try not to get up for fear of killing myselfampnbsp2017 and 2018 sucked last year got a little better and by the end of the year i decided to go back to school i decided rather abruptly and didnt have time to seek diagnosis for learning disabilities which i think i obviously have i have a diagnosis of anxiety disorders and recurrent major depressive disorder but ive assumed i wouldnt receive any accommodations for those because what can be doneampnbspinstead ive tried plowing through my feelings and intentionally making myself uncomfortable by joining clubs and going to campus in person but im not adjusting as quickly as id hoped and in the real world i will have to talk i will have to have social skills no one cares about you in the real world im old and have already exposed myself to that in the many job fields ive attempted so im aware ampnbspi just feel like im a failure and now im overloading myself and i dont want to back down but idk how to deal with everything and get no help and have nothing outside of school and working at home i need a good balance but i have literally no way of making that happen im in a club that meets once a week the paper which is 1x a month and now a new club that no one showed up for so i became club leader this will force me into social situations and i hope that i can do it in my head im telling myself to just do it so i try and i talk and garbage comes out and im older than everyone else so its awkward im not supposed to be so immature and stupid by social standards ampnbspi feel like im just not going to make it i have straight as but i feel like i dont deserve them my art never looks good to me even after spending hours working i need to make this work but i dont know how i dont know how to change who ive been for 29 years in an instant but i desperately want to i want to be different i dont want to be who i am anymore in the meantime im trying to squeeze in time with my so and getting very little sleep most of it is just time in the same room not even interacting or talking or anything and i feel really void of any affection and social interaction right now as well as anything fun i used to walk every day its something that lessens the frequency of nerve pain and i dont even have time for that the weather has been shit anyway i dont find gaming fun i dont like to sit but thats all im doing im exhausted ampnbspi dont even know what im getting at anymore with this im just frustrated with life everything is dullim over stressedlonely and i honestly just hate myself everything about myself is awful i really hate who i am i became really sick in the first few weeks of school and have had bronchitis for about 34 weeks its getting better but i feel like that happening really fucked a lot up for me since i had no energy i dont know how to manage everything or how to socialize i feel like i should just kill myself but i dont know how to even do it properly in a way that wont be totally awful im looking to get away from pain and if the last minutes of my life could at least be peaceful that would be well ideal i really wish assisted suicide for

1340,Maintaining Relationships with People,hellofirst of all i really appreciate that you are taking the time to read my post and whether you were able to provide me with advice or not thank youi feel like in order to give a better understanding of my situation i need to talk about what ive gone through im sorry that it end being a very long postwhen i was a kid i was pretty much normal and had my group of friends but i used to be very shy and faced a lot of verbal abuse at that time but kept quite and thought it was a normal and ok thing it didnt affect me though very much because of that however in middle school ive experienced trauma that changed me forever and left a very deep scar on me emotionally that took me years to overcome because no one tried to help those who see me went through it and those who i spoke to about it didnt try to help for years i had trust issues and was paranoid most of the time it was my first experience of feeling alone and that no one understands me and slowly i started to drift away and shut myself out i just wanted to be alone and because of that i started to lose friends but i didnt care at that time i thought i was doing the right thing by avoiding as much social interaction as possible i guess in a way i was trying to protect myselfthe years after that ive tried to regain my social life back and make friends again i tried everything that i can from trying to act as a happy and funny person cause no one wants to see the real me my depressing and sad self who wants to make friends with such a person and when it actually works out i thought i was doing the right thing but it ends up making me more depressed cause it takes me a lot of effort to be that person and i really didnt felt like im making any deep connection with anyone so i was like screw it ill just be myself by which i mean that i will not try anything to be forcefully liked by others and i thought since im into so many things i will probably find someone who is into one of these things and be friends with but that didnt work out either i kinda became that extra friend in a group that her existence or not didnt make any difference or that friend who you come to when your other friends are not around or that person you hang out not because you enjoy their company but you just dont want to be sitting alone that messed me up in my senior year of high school i felt like shit and i spent most of the time during the break in the toilet cause i rather that than feeling like shit when i am with others and just to be clear they are not awful people and they didnt say anything bad to me its just ive been friends with them for so long and whether at that time when i was trying to be the funny and happy person or myself either way i never felt i belong or that anyone cared i felt i was just someone they knew and sure why not they can call a friendin college though is where my struggle peaked all those friendships that i made in high school are slowly disappearing everyone was moving on with their lives and i guess that means leaving unwanted relationships behind but regardless i did what i thought was right and did my part ive reached out to them but it always ends up a onesided relationship with everyone apparently and no one will reach out to me if i dont so i stopped there was this one person i was close to during my school years and i tried to be the friend she can rely on in time of needs and depend on i wanted to be always there for her but she never makes time for me but somehow she can with others so i tried to put our friendship to the test and just respond coldly to her messages just to see if she will ask whats wrong i want her to notice that there was a problem and see if she gonna care about our friendship but she ends up unfollowing me in social media and blocked me out of her life that simply even though she perfectly knows me too well and knows that this is not my kind of behaviori had no problem talking with strangers i can open a conversation and interact with anyone easily so trying to get to know people in college was not difficult except i dont think anyone wanted to be my friend i just remain their classmate i end up making just one friend in college we had a lot in common and i really believed it could work out but it took a lot of ignoring of her frustrating attitude which sometimes makes me wonder if she will bother to hold on to me if i ever show my frustration at some point ive gone through a deep depression that made me very suicidal and thought there was no future for me but i was trying to hold on to hope and as much i want to act tough and act like i can handle this i couldnt i really just need someone to talk to and so far as you can see i had no one except this college friend and i didnt know how it will go but thought lets give it a try so i opened up to her and after when i was done the conversation didnt last for 2 minutes and i was so crushed because sure maybe she was not the perfect person to open up to but at that time i didnt have any option and i just really needed someone in my life to talk to i really thought im gonna do it on that day cause i really lost hopeas of now it feels like im back at the starting point i probably sound very awfully pathetic person or stupid to you every time when im not able to maintain any relationship in my life i asked myself whats wrong with me what have i done wrong in my life i realized after a while that i try to fix things so hard in my life that i end up breaking it or damaging it but i always thought i was doing the right thing and doing my part by reaching out or helping out but somehow it doesnt make things better it always seems that im the one making the effort and if you didnt notice throughout those stages of my life that i mentioned no one tried to be my friend or wanted to but ive always seemed to be the one who wants to be someones friend right now im very much confused about what exactly im supposed to do i just dont understand why im struggling so much to find somewhere i belong i feel very much rejected no matter what i do if i make an effort or not i end up alone either way everyone in my life seems to give up on me and no one bothers to hold on to me i just dont know if im supposed to give up and just accept the fact that maybe this is how things supposed to be in my lifei tried not to bore you guys with the details and complicate stuff i hope my situation was made clear and it wasnt confusing i just really need some advice cause i dont think im going to find a good one from my mind one again thank you for taking the time to read my post,1,suicidal

to my mom and step dad being too busy with work and running a business and my dad is probably somewhere rotting in arizona my sister is deployed in the navy and the other ran away a few years ago and havent heard from her and my older brother is a drug addict that cut ties with us a long time ago i dont want to message a suicide hotline out of fear they will send an ambulance or force me into a hospital forcing bills on me that i can not afford and i have no one close to talk to about it my situation is growing up my parents both lived in different bad areas with little money i was never smart or talented at anything besides having an over active imagination i always had a learning issue both with paying attention and remembering information regardless of how hard i tried didnt have a lot of friends and ended up dropping out of high school about 3 years ago i went back and got my adult diploma with the hopes it would be enough to get me on my feet im now almost 26 and just a few months ago after i saw someone about my mental health i found out i have add so some things where answered there but it didnt help much the small amount of friends that i have have become aware of my increasing depressed emotions and have tried to help but for the most part they seem to pay no mind to it ive working dead end jobs for most of my adult life until recently when i took a boot camp course in the information technology field i then interned for 5 weeks and after got a position working for a small company as an it help desk technician under a 3 month to perm contract or thats what they told me during the interview i never did anything it related and the contract was constantly extend by 3 months until my 9th month there in that time ive worked for some bad companies but i have never worked somewhere that treated there specifically the us employees so poorly they then after promising to increase my pay hired me on full time as salary and cut my pay thinking i wouldnt notice i then secretly started looking for new positions starting last july until november of last year when i was tired of they way they have treated me for over a year and without thinking just left even though i have monthly bills on top of the learning problems i also have extreme anger problems and am very very impatient as far as work goes i have applied to countless it positions since last july with professional help updating resumes and cover letters and re learning trying to as much it knowledge as i can after using pretty much none of it at my last job and forgetting almost all of it but ive gotten nothing i have had 2 companies interview me and reject me after the 2nd or 3rd interview and all of the other countless companies ive applied to have either flat out rejected me or have not said anything i have next to nothing left with money and if i dont find something soon i will lose everything and i can only imagine how bad my credit will be and the law suits to follow other than job things i have never been in a real relationship i never see my family even though i literally live with my mom and step dad i almost never see my friends i have an extreme hate for people im assuming due to everything ive had to go through over the years and every day i spend hours trying to teach myself new things and applying for any position available that could possible help me with my situation but since the last interview rejection and the constant no reply and email rejections i cant anymore ive tried so hard to make things better for myself seeking medical help close support from family and friends and will power but its always one step forward and then being launched back im tired of starting over im tired of only knowing rejection and being ignored not just from jobs but from everything i have become so angry and hate filled that i cant see happiness in anything i used to love movies and video games and cant find joy in those the only piece of escape i have day to day is music because it almost thinks for me im listening to it but i feel like its also listening to me feeling my constant pain and emotional wreck everyone says it will get better but ive been at this for so long and it only keeps getting worse i have put the effort in but its like some deity is purposefully trying to prevent me from being happy or making myself successful and over the past few weeks i cant stop thinking of killing myself making this awful pain go away and not feeling anything anymore the only thing that holds me back is the thought of what comes after possible non existence which i cant even comprehend just not knowing is the only thing holding me back but even that fear is starting to go away and taking an early exit seems more and more like the best optioni apologize for the extremely long post maybe just a way to leave a small mark on existence to make myself feel a little better i dont seem myself feeling any better even if my hard work eventually gets me anywhere a family a job that actually pays enough for me to live on my own not constantly worrying if i have enough for food and water or if i have to cut that out to make my payments its hard to feel happy or accomplished when all you know is failure and loss there is more but i feel like ive said enough if anyone even reads this ive re read this and gone over it a few times and i just keep feeling worse and adding more to it thank you to whoever takes the time to read this,1,suicidal
1491,My ex attempted suicide,i got way too attached and when she ghosted me i wanted to hate her but i couldnt so i hated myself at one point the only thing holding me back was the thought of living if i failed fast forward a year out of no where she attempts suicide it made me realize how much i still cared about her i dont feel like i deserve to be as broken down as i am though i cared so much about her and she probably didnt even think of me for a moment i was just another stupid dude to her everything about it is fueling my self hatred,1,suicidal

1493,I don't really think if one phrase could even describe how destroyed am I,i dont even know how to start i always thought about one thing that always tortures my brain everyone are the same but i am not when i was a child being child was the perfect excuse to hide my condition i dont know how to talk to people i dont know how to prolong a conversation i dont know anything about being sociable in the other hand i was and i am really smart but i dont really qualify myself about something special because people are so stupid to think about being selfcentered instead of thinking about the personality itself thats maybe one of the thing i dont even comprehend about society well i continue being able to do whatever you want its something amazing i felt i feel i got the most powerful superpower being able to think about something interesting to do and make it real make it like i was professional on something but if you cant even talk even express yourself your brain all of your amazing ideas are taking down to trash to something miserable how much kids teens worried about the things other people say i worry too but im 100 sure they can shine if they are with the correct people ask me im 22 now in 22 years why didnt i find anyone like me anyone who i can talk about interesting things and not about superficial and stupid things anyone who takes the life like a poetry with right values anyone who understands me anyone who i can be myselfi hated my school partners and they always thought about things on how to ruin my day i didnt understand why being so small being so tiny they were so disrespectful to each other i lived on a city that i cant even pronounce its name because is the reason of all my misfortunes people so damn vulgar so damn low they cant even teach their kids how to be kind how to be respectful to anyone i learn about pride that keep me away from bullying they dont even know why they bullied me bullies tend to attack people about their body about if they are stupid about a condition they just attack me because it was me and i know they smell it like dogs possessed maybe because i didnt find a reasonable reason to understand what they bullied me but in the middle of that i thought why just cant we be friends why do we attack to each other only because i cant be vulgar like you they is the reason why i hate my ethnicity this stupid language called spanish talked only by freaking stupid people because i learned about they every single piece of word they say why my country is infested with thirdworldpeople they are way too worried about lgbt and inclusiveness why didnt they included me on societythere was a guy alvaro c was and still is his name he was the most disgusting profane putrid and revolting person i ever met he was just a compulsive masturbator obsessed with pornography i remember when he checked the teacher computer just for looking for sexual content when he masturbates in class i couldnt care less about his life except for one thing he didnt let me breathe one miserable day when i was in school he just looked for me to having some daily fun lets make this piece of st even more st than he actual is he thought i cried trying to understand why me what did i got in myself that makes me so despreciable he didnt know about what thing inserted in my mind now im him now its me who have a problem with porn addictionwhen i was 14 i decided to play guitar not only that now im feeling that im able to put some music on the radio with some effort and money but i dont have the energy left to do something actually i just dont have energy to do nothing more than just laying in my bed and watching these repulsive videos that i hate but i cant left behind for some reason this thing is just consuming my brain all my abilities my smartness my heart my soul i want to leave it but im thinking that i have no reason to do that because for me now life is just pointless is just about being stupid thinking stupid talking stupid living stupid dont try to be some special for this world because this world will take you and make you descend down to their level descend down to hell and if you make it to the top maybe its because you are like they by default i got ideas still have some beautiful ideas but im alone waiting for someone to help me that will never come suicide is just a boring option i know if i just die no one will notice and i hate that i will not take that option because i dont want to give them the pleasure of that its freaking hypocrite when these criminals of society cry to a fallen relative cry is a emotion just for good people so you know now why they dont cry me but instead cry to themselves you may not believe in god but you can make sure the devil is in one of us waiting just for destroy everyone else and every piece of you disguised as everything you know the more you think everything is normal the more you are far away from comprehend that life this

1507,2-16-2020,on the morning of february 16 2020 i took my cat to the emergency vet to have her checked out she was extremely skinny and was not moving and hadnt eaten or used the bathroom in 2 days she barely wanted to be around anyone and her muscules were so weak she couldnt even use her back legs or stand she would just drag herself to where she wanted to go then lay down exhausted i thought she was going to die the night before but miraculously she survived but was still extremely weak and exhausted lookingi put her in her pet cage and drove to the emergency vet the vet examined her and immediately became accusatory and critical of me and how my kitty got into the position that she was in asking me every question under the sun what did i give her to eat whats her past medical history and maybe about 40 other questions  even calling my cat a train wreck she was in horrible condition and he kept telling me things such as well if you wouldve taken her to your regular vet and had checkups sooner all of this couldve been prevented you shouldve given her her medicine hyperthyroidism is manageable and bc you didnt do this and that your cat is in the condition that shes in   which just made me feel so damn guilty i wanted to take her away right then and there he then tells me that he couldnt feel her liver and that she only had 25 of her kidneys working and that she was extremely dehydratedhe mentioned giving her medicine and iv drips and changing her diet but because of the state she was in he said it wouldnt do much at all at this point because her kidneys would eventually fail so then he suggests euthanasia and my heart dropped like a rock i didnt want to do it i wanted to give her the medicine i was hell bent on it ill pay it now i dont care what the price is ill pay it now but he kept pushing me and my sister to sign up for a credit plan to pay for it because he simply didnt want to be the bank he even said that we could give her all of the medicine and change her diet etc and theres a possibility that it still wont work at all because of how debilitated she was eventually our family made the decision to have her put to sleep on the same day as the visit we had a previous cat who passed away due to kidney failure and we didnt want her to go through the same thing we all snuggled her kissed her and pet her until she breathed her final breath on the table it was heart wrenching we didnt want to bring her home because we all live with out 80 year old grandmother who prior to having her put to sleep my grandmother would see her dragging her legs and see how weak and exhausted she looked and would start crying and saying how she didnt want to see the cat suffer like that anymore  we didnt want to bring her home because we didnt want anything to happen to grandma so  we had everything done in one day and it all happened so fast im still torn about it i feel like i can go back in time and pull her away from the table and bring her to present day i miss you so much misty  my little baby it felt like we all yanked you out of this world too soon and thats what drives me crazy the regular vet i tookher to long ago when we first found out about it told us all that she had hyperthyroidism all 3 of us were in charge of making sure she got her medicine until she finished it and then it dwindled down to just me having the responsibility i was in a very stressed out mindset between my shit job with no set hours  and  taking care of my grandmother who has dementiawe have to make sure she dosent wander outside or anything and had completely forgotten was counting on other family members to give her her medicine because i was not home i had forgotten that she even took  medicine at all because she was doing so well she was eating and playing until about last year when i went to have her ears checked thats when they reminded me and it all went downhill so again i gave her her medicine and she  finished it only to find out this year she would have to be put to sleep i never intended to hurt you misty i never wanted you to get so sick every morning i cry my eyes out wishing you were here with me on my bed or licking my hand or even meowing that cute little hello meow you used to do every day i think about the what ifs and the if onlys i cant even smell or look at certain things anymore i cant smile or be happy anymore without my baby i bought a box cutter last week because i was seriously contemplating ending my own life because of the horrible guilt i feel like i murdered that cat i feel like i purposefully let her get sick and die  i felt like she didnt need to be euthanized it was my responsibility to make sure you got your medicine and i fucked up so bad i dont want to live anymore feeling like this im so sorry my sweet baby kitty   how can i help my grandmother if i failed to help you i feel like im the only one in the world dealing with this situation i  know im not but i just want to fucking die i hate existing everyday i wake up im reminded that my cat is gone my best friend my baby is dead and i caused it and i want to throw up i hate living i want to die and just not

1525,Another long frustrated rant,so ive been seeing a therapist for a couple of months now and besides all the other upsides of therapy i think my favorite and also most frustrating part is that my therapist confirmed that i am incredibly selfaware to the point that she usually just agrees with me and i spend a lot of my sessions just talking to myself because i already know why my thoughts are irrational i know i shouldnt let these things bother me i know im not alone i know this is an ongoing thing i know i know i know and thats so frustrating because knowing doesnt make me feel any better knowing i need to learn how to like myself better and be okay to be alone  doesnt help me actually get there and when i get there or think ive gotten there i dont really feel any better yes im lonely i should learn to enjoy my own company and spend time with people who actually want to be with me great done that do this all the fucking time but i feel the same im still lonely i still hate myself worst part is that i cant even blame anyone or anything i did this im doing this im the problem my therapist part of the problem is that i overthink and keep having these expectations for myself that i should try to just do what feels right but i already do that if anything i do it too much thats why im starting to accumulate so much junk in my house idk i just wanted to let the usual ramblings in my head out somewhere im tired,0,depression

1576,What depression feels like,i cant put it into words all the time but depression to me feels like i go through life with this tight tight pressure just squeezing on my heart all day long and i just have to ignore it and go throughout my day with nobody knowing whats going on but when i snap and i cry its because the pressure has just built up too much and i just cant handle it anymore but i only snap in private because once you cry and once those emotions are out of your system and you have momentary relief you think well that was silly and its not that deep im fine and then this cycle of pressure builds up all over again and you just have to pretend like nothings wrong but youre truly not ok i cant explain this to the people in my life cause ive always thought maybe im just making up my depression because i can go throughout my day im not bed bound but if i reflect on my life ive always tried to cope in some way i used to binge eat so much and i notice i have the urge to do it whenever im feeling especially down then it was movies amp tv shows i would drown myself in for hours and hours then it was music to drown out my own thoughts it was reading endlessly at some point but ive lost all interest in all of those things and i find being awake to be so draining so now all i do is go to my classes and go to sleep i hate being awake i hate feeling this pressure in my chest and it sucks because i was free from it for a few months and its back and you just try and tell yourself youre just having a bad day but you know its some sort of relapse its hard because i dont want to take medication i dont know if thats going to make things worse for me and i dont want to be numb i just dont want to feel pain on top of that theres so much fucking stigma i cant talk to my parents about it cause whenever i do they get angry i feel sad because im their eyes theyve given me the perfect life despite all the abuse when i was a child i cant talk to my friends cause theyre all optimists with the it gets better attitude and it pisses me off cause all i want is to get held and just cry i always feel like im being punished for something and i dont know what cause i try so hard to be there for others whenever i cant find love and i see ordinary people super happy in relationships i question whats wrong with me im not saying im super attractive but i have assets that would at least attract people when i start questioning why i cant find a good relationship or someone who likes me it loops back into my thought of well how do i expect that to happen if my own father walked out on me as a child everything just fucking sucks and i cant even focus enough to do my uni and itjustsucks,0,depression
1577,Is it really such a bad thing?,hey this is really weird for me and i wouldnt normally do something like this but i dont really know what else to do ever since i was a little kid i have thought life was pretty pointless and i kinda just wanted to die as i grew up it gradually got worse and at this point i seriously just want to kill myself i dont have a bad life or anything i have just been searching for so long and ive never found a reason to want to be here i have always had a problem making friends i am always there for people and i love being able to help people people just dont like me it could be a perception thing tho in any case i just spent two years with someone who i believe to be one of the most amazing people in the world i loved him so much and genuinely thought i would spend the rest of my life with him but he broke up with me he told me he was never happy with me and it broke me i have met millions of people and i dont believe i will ever be happy with someone like i was with him i cant be happy without him and he cant be happy with me but to be his friend and see him happy with someone else would tear me to pieces everyone says ill move on and be happy again but its been months and it still feels fresh as the day it happened the only reason i am still here is because of my mom she guilt trips me into not committing suicide even though she has also always been suicidal she also doesnt believe in therapy and thinks making your bed will make the depression go away the idea of killing my self isnt scary to me and i know the people in my life will be sad but i am not enough of anything to anyone for it to be a big deal idk why im posting this guess im just wondering what other people think about it,1,suicidal

1600,"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement",weve been seeing a worrying increase in prosuicide content showing up here and and also going unreported this undermines our purpose here so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide  weve created a wiki that covers these issues  we hope this will be helpful to anyone whos wondering whether somethings okay here and which responses to report  it explains in detail why any validation of suicidal intent even an innocent message like if youre 100 committed ill just wish you peace is likely to increase peoples pain and why its important to report even subtle prosuicide comments the full text of the wikis current version is below and it is maintained at rsuicidewatchwikiincitementhttpwwwredditcomrsuicidewatchwikiincitement we deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive empathetic nonjudgemental support to our ops and we particularly thank everyone whos already been reporting incitement in all forms  please report any post or comment that encourages suicide or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar to

rsuicidewatchwikiincitementhttpwwwredditcomrsuicidewatchwikiincitement  summaryits important to respect and understand peoples experiences and emotions its never necessary helpful or kind to support suicidal intent there are some common misconceptions discussed below about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause wellmeaning people to inadvertently incite suicide there are also people online who incite suicide on purpose often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful validate feelings and experiences not selfdestructive intentionswere here to offer support not judgement  that means accepting with the best understanding we can offer whatever emotions people express  suicidal people are suffering and were here to try to ease that by providing support and caring  the most reliable way we know to deescalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood that means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are or telling them what to do or not do  but theres an important line to draw here  theres a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding nonjudgmentally to suicidal thoughts and in any way endorsing encouraging or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs anything that condones suicide even passively encourages suicide it isnt supportive and does not help it also violates reddits sitewide rules as well as our guidelines explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions do not treat any ops post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and cant change their minds or be helped anyone whos able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living even if theyve also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide made a suicide plan or started carrying it out  in the most useful empirical model we havehttpswwwapaorgscienceaboutpsa200906scibrief the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer these factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world so any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent even something innocent like i hope you find peace is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a persons sense that theyre unwelcome in the world it will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded  how to avoid validating suicidal intentkeep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide   people who say they dont want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesnt invalidate their emotions unfortunately many popular good responses are actually counterproductivehttpswwwspeakingofsuicidecom20150303whatnottosay in particular many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that its not so bad and this is usually experienced as i dont understand what youre going through and im not going to try  people whove had help that made them feel worse dont want any more of the same  it doesnt mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive cant give them any comfort     most people who are suicidal want to end their pain not their lives  its almost never true that death is the only way to end these peoples suffering of course there are exceptional situations and we certainly acknowledge that for some people the right help can be difficult to find but preventing someones suicide doesnt mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding  an unfixable problem doesnt mean that a good life will never be possible  we dont have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better its important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed  for every kind of difficult life situation you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair and others who cope amazingly well and a whole spectrum in between a key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time this can depend on many personal and situational factors but when theres not enough interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it  we go into more depth on the it gets better issue in this psa posthttpswwwredditcomrsuicidewatchcomments25igd7whatswrongwithitgetsbetterwhatifitdoesnt which is always linked from our sidebar community info on mobile guidelines  there are always more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their livesto avoid accidentally breaking the antiincitement rule dont say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea or that someone cant turn back or is already dead  do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome at least in this little corner of the world  our talking tipshttpredditigh87 offer more detailed guidancelook out for deliberate incitement  it may come in disguiseoften comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenonhttpsenwikipediaorgwikiwilliamfrancismelchertdinkel people like this are out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them  they will typically try to scratch their psychological itch by saying things that push people closer to the edge  they often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above  specifically you might see people doing the following encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying  there are always more and better choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or helping actively or passively them to end their lives creating an artificial and toxic sense of solidarity by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy  they will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person while either directly or indirectly encouraging their selfloathing emotions and selfdestructive impulses  since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation  many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help  a couple of key points to keep in mind  skilled suicide intervention  peer or professional  is based on empathic responsiveness to the persons feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment  contrary to popculture myths it does not involve persuasion dont do it cheerleading youve got this or meaningless false promises trust me it gets better or invalidation let me show you how things arent as bad as you think  anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses or any other response that prolongs their pain from expert help may be covertly prosuicide of course people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mentalhealth treatment and its fine to vent about those but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone elses hope of getting help choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someones trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible  any kind of involuntary intervention is an extremely unlikely outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline confidentiality is addressed in more detail in our hotlines faq posthttpreddit1c7ntr the goal is always to provide all help with the clients full knowledge and informed consent we know that no individual or system is perfect  mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people and we have

(Text wall alert),29m depression and ocd started off 50mg sertraline 3 weeks ago for two weeks raised to 75mg one week ago dear mods if this is not the right place kindly let me know if would be great if you could direct me to the right subredditenglish is not my first language so please bear with metldri have done a lot of reading when i procrastinate from work i want to start a daily journal on reddit to keep track of my positives and negatives my progress and hopefully get advices on when i go wrong i noticed that i get overtly stressed over tiny choresworkthings to do and id like to tackle it via progressive increase in exposure and desensitization then incorporate other cbt techniquesstorybackgroundi have only recently been diagnosed with major depressive disorder after a close friend forced me to looking back now i think i first had mild depression around 16yoi recall having a general apathy towards life results ambition family and friends any motivation is fleeting and id spend most of my days daydreaming perhaps hoping for some catastrophe in the school so that im no longer boredthe depression seemingly subsided  at least i think so  as i continued on aimlessly on some path my familyculturefriends expected of me while im not excelling im not underperforming i have close group of friends and we enjoy movies and outingsit all went to hell when i was around 2223yo i should add that i have contamination ocd and during my university days decided against my better judgement that i should live with a close friendthis proved horrible as my ocd meant i couldnt live normally or telerate their habits i thought i had it in control and hid my oddities well i didnt my housemates at the time hated me and talked loads behind my back all the while i was oblivious about their hatred towards me while they acted normal around me i noticed somewhere around 3 months in i had the chance to look through their messages and curiousity started my depressionreading through all those hate filled complaints and messages was painful having to sleep in the same room as him after was impossivle to act civil while i moved out was tough while we did not have a big fight because we both hated confrontationour 6year friendship fell apart along with it i resolutely cut ties with the entire group of friends that was associated with this guy i believe this to be the event which kickstarted my depression worse still i moved to a different place and had another falling out with another group of housemates we started off great even went on a trip together in about two months i dont recall the cause of it but i remember they confronted me on something and i just started withdrawing from them after that i stopped going to lectures and classes i was fired from my club because i couldnt perform anymore i spent the first year making it into the committee as a result i graduated with a subpar gpa ive never felt worse i feel like i disaappointed my dad wasted his money and failed to prove myself to those who looked down on mei spent the next two years isolating myself in my room only going out for groceries if i absolutely have to i avoided the housemates by being active at odd hours i lied to my family that i was trying and failing to apply for jobs while the truth is i mindlessly watched seasons after seasons of brainless tv i am eternally thankful that my dad supported me through this lie he paid for my rent food and courses i took because i wanted to extend my visa oh i was also an international student so you can imagine how much money that costed i cannot begin to describe the amount of guilt i feel the reason im even trying to get better is because of guilt my main motivation is to make them proud of mewhen i was 27 i spent a year dodging their concerned calls they were so worried they sent a friend over to check on me and finally they took a flight over themselves my visa finally expired and i went homeafter getting home i once again lied to them about job searching and spent a year doing my best to avoid family events and outings finally last year they forcefully got me a job with my relatives and ive feel into a routine since theni majored in finance and accounting in uni but my results were subpar and it has been 34years at this point i barely remember a thing and i cant perform i cant even get myself to pick the knowledge back up admittedly though the work i perform doesnt require that much but alas i fail to perform i find it difficult to get myself to issue a simple invoice which takes 5muinutes tops i am more and more disappointed in myself over time i hate the job but i havent even sent out a single resume the very thought of going for interviews and exposing myself as incompetent frightens me getting judged by anonymous hr people makes me hate myselfi contemplated all kinds of alternatives ie getting a remote part time job so that i can make extra income while improving myself taking courses online and hopefully put me ahead of othersultimately though i have not brought myself to do any of those things even this reddit post took 5days of contemplating before i could do iti know what i should do and people will say you never know if you never try but i cant help but imagine the negatives posting for help on reddit for example opens me up to judgement from random strangers trolls even scams some of them incredibly damaging improving myself via coursesbookslectures can be an enormous time sink not to mention that what is learned may not even be useful to me in the future and may end up being a waste of timecurrently i spend the measly 4 hours of free time i get after getting back from work watching movies or reading novels theyre not entertaining nor boring but they keep me sane i dread the day that they are taken away analysisgrowing up ive been instilled with the idea that i am smart but lazy i believe this became a part of my core identify im 29 and i dont recall ever working hard for anything ive coasted through life however largely because my parents made me go to numerous additional tuitions cram classes etc ive never done homework mostly copied them off of friends but have the concept repeated to you enough times and it gets carved into memorymy results up till 15yo were always above average i believe due to the circumstances i grew up without developing any selfdiscipline skills never having an aim or goal and simply going through the motions meant i was lost the moment those guidance were taken away believing myself to be smart also creates a subconcious anxiety  what if i worked hard but still failed that would mean im not smartthroughout life i have had a panic attack twice once when i was 10 an art project which took me 20minutes tops was criticised and i broke down in tears and hyperventilated having to be taken home from schoolthe next was when i was 16 around this time i was getting progessively more apathetic at school i struggled to get up in the morning and was often late to school i was late for 10 times and my parents were called to school which resulted in me hyperventilating once againi also spent a lot of time gaming which i believe was some sort of coping mechanism similar to mindlessly watching youtube or browsing reddit not entirely sure what these events mean but i think i can conclude that i have an inability to accept criticism or face consequences of my own actions what i want to doas stated above i want to tackle my selfdisclipline responsibility avoidance and anxiety towards work via progressively increasing exposure i will practice mindful relaxation and attempt to associate the relaxation with the triggerworki will also journal on reddit 1 to have accountability 2 to further dissect my thoughts analyze the issues solve them and 3 to get advice    thank you for reading this far or if you skipped thanks anyways for your time i may have left out some details or major events in life im not entirely sure and im too

1651,Need another perspective?,i had a depressive episode so i moved back home and have had depression for years but never confided in anyone my parents are great and caring and my mom is even a nurse like 80 of the time theyre greatbut sometimes my mom can bug me like in the waiting room at the clinic while waiting to get recommended for a psychiatrist for depression she says you still have it rightlike what she has a nursing degree and asked that i mean shes usually very supportive but just this small thing makes me very confused i am doing much better now that i have a routine and am not alone and suicidal everyday but just because you dont see my depression doesnt mean my depression went awayive hid it for at least 6 years and i was very good at it im an actor but it irks me that she would say thatim 19 and sorta tall sometimes when were out shopping or something she talks about things that id rather not discuss in the middle of the mall like oh yeah we should discuss when you should attend classes and we never discuss this at homeit feels like shes justifying my presence like this is why im here with my 19 year old son on a monday shopping and hes not in school honestly its embarrassing and even if im overthinking it i feel anxiety in public and i really dont like standing outim pretty sure my depressions from her side of the family as she and her grandmother have had antidepressants dont get me wrong were close and i love her but sometimes its very annoying and any constructive criticism i give the way she responds is never in a way that doesnt make me feel guilty about pointing something outwhenever theres a problem she seems to blow it out of proportion and ive stopped trying to help because if we go down a wrong street i become implicated in the problem and she makes it feel as if the world is ending even though everything works out sometimes it feels like she lets things go wrong on purpose i cant even count the times we have gone out for something and she forgot her bags or we forgot to bring some package for the post office or something similar whenever this happens she says oh i should have thought of that im so stupid i should have known and it makes me feel as if she is expecting me to remind her of these things i appreciate all the things she does but if its something she organizes for example shopping like i have no control over what she forgets to bring but she somehow makes me feel responsible or at least i do somehow i just cant understand this negative side to her and it seems like somethings always wrong and if it is she exacerbates it i cant tell if its from her depression if she has low self esteem and is hard on herself if she makes mistakes or makes mistakes on purpose regardless it affects mei know not everything here was directly about depression but i thought because it relates to my situation might as well say whats on my minddoes anyone else have perspective on having depressions and living with parents im lucky to have supportive parents but sometimes im not sure how to deal,0,depression

1812,Rediscovering Meaning in the midth of it,to everyone out there the people who have suffered from depression perhaps for many years this is my first post i am like so many of you lying in bed have been for many months known this state for decadesyou are not alone and whoever you believe yourself to be right now that is not true remember the person you were when you were fine happy in a better place feel it embody that i know that i am holding on to it and if life has been mostly dark it helps to believe that experiences of happiness and joy exist somewhere outside of this statejust like martin luther king believed in his dreams even at that particular time it seemed impossiblei do not know what caused you to land hard in this state for me it was relationship loss failure deep loneliness and isolationi have no family and lost my relationshipfriendships to depression people left though life circumstances financial issuesliving environment and of course the abusive childhood and my reactions to them eg blaming myself selfsabotage feeling futile discouraged bad habits unhelpful implicit relational and emotional patterns that keep repeating whatever it is that led into this black hole i guess the situation gets more frustrating with every attempt to heal that did not work i tried many medications almost all of them several psychiatric stays several years of therapy cbt depth psychology the hoffmann process all kinds of meditations body work giving up and surrender eckhart tolle etc you name it they all helped a little but nothing really worked in the long termand it sucks that nothing seem to work permanently however i deeply believe that there is meaning imprinted in everyones heart what is your life worth living what would you like to experience  if you were dying what really matters to youlying in bed can you imagine and feel experiencing it the happiness the joy whatever it is you wish for in every ayahuasca experience and every other methods that helped me temporary what really helped was seeing clearly this pattern of depression replaying the thoughts the emotional pain the energetic pattern and then break free of it for a while until familiar patterns reemerge it is like getting on a diet and putting on weight again rebuilding relationships is a huge part of my recovery so i guess i wanted to reach out to you and ask the question what dreams do you have today how can you believe in them in your head first and in your body often the despair is exactly next to this dream but keep building that belief you are not alone please do not give up i will not either,0,depression
1813,Life is unbearable. I'm losing my mind. I wish I had the courage to end this shit. Praying that someone out there reads this.,ive been realizing some damn hard truths about myself ive never been happy ever since i was a little kid i felt like i was bad you know how children play house and it can be used in therapy to evaluate their outlook and issues when i was a kid i would play house with my fingers there was the mom dad brother and sister me the pinky finger each time everyone would gang up on and beat up the sister i just remembered that i used to play that game the other day  i dont think i have any real excuse for that i was anxious as hell from a young age and irritable as fuck but what kind of kid thinks of that shit i was messed up back thenive talked to professionals they seem to think that this is more than anxiety and depression they say that ive faced a lot of trauma in my life i suppose it makes sense my parents were heavily abused during their childhoods my mom even tried to kill herself as a young kid my dad was an abusive alcoholic for most of my childhood he and my mom would fight a lot  they would swear at each other he would hit and throw things at her she would scream at him and they would usually tell each other to go to hell or drop dead my dad was verbally abusive and i remember he would hit my brother too i presume he hit me but i dont remember all i remember is that when i was a teenager he got so angry at me that he held me down on the couch i was so detached all i thought was how he was so angry he was about to drool on me and how it was gross i love my parents despite their flaws i just dont like them we fight all the time when i was younger i remember that often when i got into a row with one parent the other would get involved and then they would fight with each other they would say horrible things like what i said above they would say awful things to me too like how once i was mad and my mom said i should look in the mirror to see how ugly i look she would tell me to get out of her sight a lot i get called a bitch at times im told i treat them horrible and i hate myself even more when they say that ugh on the note of trauma i realized earlier this year that i was repeatedly raped oral not vaginal by my ex over the course of a year or so thats also been tough to processits fucked because i know my parents love me they read to me as a child they taught me to be independent they just want me to be happy but theres just always been something missing i guessi realized that i may be in a chronic state of mild dissociation i often feel detached from my body my emotions my environment other people i feel like im in a fog my limbs arent quite attached to my body i feel floaty or dizzy weak and shaky at times i dissociate harder and i go totally numb cant move cant talk things look smaller i float above or behind my body my vision gets weird its scary yet comfortable because im aware that im further detached from myself and in a limbo for an hour it fades and i get a headache my body hurts and im exhausted then its back to reality and i feel even more off for the rest of the day ive noticed i also mildly dissociate when i try to sleep my head is disconnected from my body my limbs feel large or disconnect from my body its incredibly disturbing and i dont know why it happens i never even realized i apparently dissociate until i started thinking about my childhood experienced some crazy depersonalization and derealization when it happened i realized that it was very familiar and i remembered doing it a lot as a kid that realization fucked me upwhat really makes me feel crazy is the apparent somatic symptoms i developed chronic visual snow and headaches as a teenager i also started getting ocular migraines numerous tests and exams showed that all is well  its just stress my mouth has been hurting for the past year as well i even got an extra wisdom tooth removed thinking that was the source of the pain nope the pain persists and is very noticeable when im stressed xrays and exams show that things are fine i feel like a damn hypochondriac or like im malingeringbut this is all very real to mei feel weak a lot i am also dizzy or like my brain is rotting or stuffed with cottonfog my head is never clear i cant focus on much working is difficult i cant truly interact with friends or family anymore my weight has been all over due to horrible anxiety i had lost a third of my body weight in 9 months when i fell into this double depression i lost 14 pounds in 2 weeks then someone i care about confronted me about the seriousness of it all i tried to maintain my weight and it worked for a month then i had a little breakdown and lost 7 pounds in 5 days started an antidepressant and became apathetic as hell  had an aborted suicide attempt and binge ate like crazy even though i wasnt hungry i was like fuck it i deserve to gain weight and look disgusting ive gained 10 pounds in a week i hate myself so muchthe more i realize the more i hate myself ive tried six or seven antidepressants ive tried therapy a few times and am trying again on another med right now it all feels so damn hopeless ive wanted to die since i was 13 and every day is just full of more pain and despair people tell me not to give up on myself but it gets more and more tempting as time goes on ever since i was 15 i always had a strong feeling i would die by suicide i figured i wouldnt kill myself until i was 27 or 28 but things are becoming more disasterous i just wish i had the courage to end this suffering soon i feel like such a disgusting coward and a fraud im ashamed to exist to take up space in this world,1,suicidal

Any day.,if you want to recognise an occasion please do so by offering extra support to those whove asked for it and by being a good citizen of the community mindful of our tips and guidelinesedit  in response to multiple requests im adding a definition of activism here  campaigning to bring about political or social change  thats straight out of the oed we arent making any special interpretation of it any post that is primarily about raising awareness or changing perceptions is activism according to the dictionary definition and thus a violation of the community rulessome examples of the most common types of activists posts we were here all of which are totally inappropriate   advocating for changes in laws around suicide advocating for change in the mentalhealth system  advocating for changes in cultural norms or common perceptions around mentalhealth  these are often related to specific days devoted to specific causes eg world suicide prevention daykeep in mind that our mission here is individual peer support  any post thats not a request for personal support regarding current experience related to suicide is probably a rule violation unless it has the mod approved flair,1,suicidal
